latest corporate unbundler reveals laid-back approach roland franklin who is leading a #m pound break-up bid for drg talks to frank kane
by frank kane
it seems that roland franklin the latest unbundler to appear in the uk has made a fatal error in the preparation of his #m break-up bid for stationery and packaging group drg
he has not properly investigated the target's dining facilities
the #-year-old head of pembridge investments through which the bid is being mounted says rule number one in this business is the more luxurious the luncheon rooms at headquarters the more inefficient the business
if he had taken his own rule seriously he would have found out that drg has a very modest self-service canteen at its bristol head office
there are other things he has on his own admission not fully investigated like the value of the drg properties or which part of the drg business he would keep after the break up
when the bid was launched last week mr franklin faced some criticism from city commentators on both those counts 
he regards the charges as unfounded
on property he is blunt 
i do not regard property profits as earnings
we have made a bid of nearly #m for a company with a book value of #m we've acknowledged there is some extra worth there but i cannot see the sort of value they are talking about in property
if they can prove it is there we might pay for it
on the other criticism he is equally dismissive
that point about the core business is very unfair he says
it is difficult to decide when you are an outsider what the business is like
we would eventually like to do it along with the management within the philosophy we will impose
the franklin philosophy was learnt in the us leveraged buyout business at the side of sir james goldsmith
mr franklin went there at the end of the # after the collapse of keyser ullman the merchant bank where he was a director that was rescued by the bank of england
he feels that keyser's problems were hastened by an unwise acquisition
he went to the us because goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the uk and france were not the places to be
along with sir james he found the us much more attractive taking over and breaking up some fairly hefty us corporations
he rejects charges that he was partly responsible for the casino atmosphere that gripped us corporate life in the early #
we stirred it up yes but we never lost any money for anybody and we never added to the unemployment figures 
what he has learned from goldsmith the only genius i have ever come across is that the holding company is not the most important unit of corporate organisation
the concept of the company does not interest me it's the businesses that are important
it does not matter whether or not drg makes sellotape or basildon bond it's of no consequence to anybody if somebody else makes them
and there is always the ultimate unbundler's defence that he will make money for his backers
in a takeover campaign that has already seen vitriolic language he responds to the charge that he is mounting the bid to enrich himself and his friends by saying nobody could take that as a criticism this is an investor group
it would be a criticism if i was doing it to impoverish myself
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr david soskin
sir i was interested by your juxtaposition of poll predicts #-seat majority for labour with tories hold on # september the latter referring of course to the conservative victory in wandsworth the significance of which appears to have been almost totally ignored by the media
electors are always prepared to criticise the government in answer to pollsters' questions but when the same individuals arrive at the polling booth they simply cannot bring themselves to vote labour into power 
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from ms molly meacher
sir despite a significant gap in the labour party's education and training proposals their objective to double the number of #-#year-olds in full-time education must be welcomed # september
england's full-time staying-on rate stands at # per cent according to the latest statistics available
this compares with # per cent in the us # per cent in sweden # per cent in west germany and # per cent in japan
to add the part-time education and training statistics to those figures does not improve our relative position 
labour hopes to transform the situation by increasing the number of a-levels to five for the brighter youngsters and providing grants for four-year training courses two years in a further education college followed by two with an employer for the rest
these reforms will only achieve their objective if accompanied by the implementation of the # education act provision for compulsory partor full-time education or training up to the age of #
this clause has never yet been activated 
the sharply reduced number of #-#-year-olds will inevitably lead employers to bid up the wages of that age group to entice young people away from education and into unskilled or semi- skilled jobs
employers must be required to release #-#-year-olds for education and training for at least two days per week
only then will two vitally important and complementary goals be achieved to improve britain's general educational and vocational competence and hence our productive capacity and to reduce our gross educational inequalities between the elite who receive a narrow education to a very high standard and the rest
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr john pertwee
sir labour does not need a commitment to proportional representation in order to scoop most of the centre ground at the next general election
all it needs is to promise a high-powered investigation such as a royal commission into the practicalities of an alternative voting system surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding
such a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voters and would have them flocking to the polls for mr kinnock
his problem will be that mrs thatcher might decide to do it first and then she will garner the votes
letter policy and politics at the labour party conference
from mr denis macshane
sir if labour is to suggest the setting up of a specialist labour court # september then such a momentous change in the industrial relations system deserves more discussion and needs to be taken out of the hot-house of labour party conference politics
for three reasons such a move should be welcomed 
first it would bring britain into line with the best european practice notably in germany where local regional and federal labour courts handle problems in a fair dispassionate way based on law precedent and judicial expertise in the labour field 
second it would ensure that workers enjoyed positive rights under law and reduce the emphasis of union immunities 
labour law will always reflect the balance of power in society and a fully fledged labour court system will not remove class and fundamental employer-employee differences
but it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd see-sawing of industrial relations legislation we have seen since #
third a labour division of the high court would contribute to the process of constitutional reform in britain which surely is to be a key political issue in the #
the trade union question would cease to haunt the labour party and while that might upset some conservatives it would be good for the country
letter independence of no-fixed 
from the rev nerissa jones
sir on saturday you published an advertisement for the # extra pages of news and features that you the independent will carry from # october
what do independent experts say about our # extra pages asks the advertisement
the supposedly jokey answers are illustrated by photographs of people sleeping outside covered by copies of the independent they look some of the hundreds of visitors who come to st botolph's crypt centre for homeless people every day 
given the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facilities in london when more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing nights of the coming winter on the streets but perhaps permanent homelessness it was terrible to see the situation being exploited for a joke by your advertisement just the thing now the evenings are drawing in 
 the added coverage is exactly what i wanted
how much independence do you suppose a person has who exists on the no-fixed- giro of # a week
letter ec immigration checks on trains
from the rev j gilmore
sir the contents of sarah helm's article immigration checks to be made on trains # september are extremely worrying
during the recent european community elections the representatives of ec governments promoted the ideal of a border-free europe by #
now it would appear from this article that this ideal is shattered and a two-tiered europe is on the cards 
one for those who travel by aircraft and one for those who travel by train between london and paris
the presence of immigration officials and police on board trains is comparable to the scenes of # america where migrant labourers were turned backat state boundaries
what criteria would police and immigration officials use in their search for potential terrorists on a train that they could not use at a static checkpoint or airport
do terrorists or illegal persons travel exclusively by train
this is a clear example of the extension of the prevention of terrorism act where criteria for stopping questioning and searching are purely subjective to the official involved
will a person's accent dress or skin colour indicate the potential terrorist or for that matter football hooligan or drug pusher
this is a recipe for fear and anxiety
it may mean the detention of innocent people and indeed their imprisonment
letter cardinal sins
from mr jimmy donoghue
sir the north-east publishers of viz are nearer the truth than they realise with their soccer strip # september
cardinal hume has not only the cross of being a fervent newcastle united supporter to bear he is also known to irreverent members of mayfair's jesuit farm street church by his initials george basil hume
latecomers who continue to hope
from anne applebaum in warsaw
dozens more east german refugees arrived outside the west german embassy yesterday seeking asylum and passage to the west including some who missed by only a few minutes a train that took more than # of their compatriots to west germany
many of the new arrivals who waited in the street outside the embassy said they were convinced there would be another train for them
the one they missed pulled out from warsaw's east station at #am yesterday carrying # cheering east germans bound for the rhine region of west germany
once upon a time another german government let lenin cross another germany in a sealed train on his way to russia
more than # years later lenin's heirs are allowing refugees from their communist regime escape in the opposite direction in an east german-made train travelling across east german territory
among those leaving was cornelia # a young east berliner destined she said for west berlin via a very circuitous route
i still don't know if my family know where i am or if they will suffer from my decision
but i saw no other way out i didn't know if i would ever have a chance again
some of the refugees had been living in polish exile for as long as seven weeks while others arrived only a few hours before west german diplomats announced they could leave
only two failed to go a new mother and her child who was born in a polish hospital four days ago
the east german government's decision to let the refugees leave across their own country came as a surprise to many including some west german diplomats
some of the refugees originally refused to touch east german territory again but were reassured when two of the west german diplomats said they would accompany the train to ensure that the rules were followed 
during the journey east german officials will enter the train and collect all east german passports
west germans will then issue new ones
legally the refugees have been expelled from east germany meaning that under current rules they cannot return
according to unofficial reports the arrangement was designed by the west german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher the new polish foreign minister krzystof skubiszewski and the soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who met recently at the united nations in new york
communists allow burial of montenegro's last king
from marcus tanner in cetinje yugoslavia
the people of montenegro yesterday welcomed home the remains of nicholas i their first and last king after # years' exile in italy in belated fulfilment of his last will and testament
thousands of montenegrins many in national costume waited at the quayside in bar for the italian warship that would bring him home
then they formed a slow procession behind the coffin into the mountains to the old royal capital of cetinje for his reburial in the monastery there
what was surely the last ever montenegrin royal event was masterminded by the republic's new communist leadership which has abruptly stopped describing nicholas as a class enemy to ride the same wave of popular patriotism and royal fervour which swept serbia in the recent celebrations of the #th anniversary of the battle of kosovo
the latest biography now calls him an outstanding statesman warrior and man of letters
if i die abroad in exile let my body rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland said the montenegrin president branko kostic reading the royal will and testament to the crowds in cetinje square who carried flags and portraits of nicholas and his queen milena
today the people of montenegro fulfill the wish of their first and last king guided by innate love and respect for their history he went on 
our tourist organisations are counting on big profits said srdan darmanovic a member of the montenegrin central committee
this will be good for the montenegrin economy too
montenegro's young and go-ahead leadership which came to power this year amid furious popular dissatisfaction with the old men in grey suits sponsored the gathering of nicholas's surviving relatives the first royal reunion organised by a communist government
a letter dropped through the post from the president of the socialist republic of montenegro inviting me to the funeral said john kennedy a conservative party member who lives in barking and is a distant relative of nicholas
montenegro's sudden rehabilitation of nicholas's memory is a popular move 
he liberated us from the turks and fought for our independence said a small boy who waited at the quayside amid a jostling crowd of former monarchs visiting serbian bishops and television crews
marko radoman # and a veteran of both balkan wars was given a place at the front as one of the few with personal memories of nicholas's reign
for a man whom rebecca west a contemporary balkan observer called repulsive and treacherous for deserting his serbian son-in-law king alexander in the first world war it is a sepia-tinted view of history
nicholas was the uncle of europe for his success in marrying his beautiful but penniless daughters into the grander royal houses of russia serbia and italy
this furthered his long-term ambition to rule a large south slav kingdom when the ottoman empire finally collapsed 
one daughter a grand duchess of russia even gained a footnote in history by introducing an unknown monk rasputin to the russian tsarina alexandra
in his minute inaccessible capital which today has only # inhabitants nicholas erected a miniature european court and an exquisitely furnished victorian palace
he even persuaded # european powers to turn cottages into full embassies
it was a fair achievement in a town which an earlier observer described as # hovels
but nicholas's grand design collapsed in # when his serbian son-in-law alexander deposed him and incorporated montenegro into yugoslavia
obituary virgil thomson
by peter dickinson
virgil thomson was a composer and writer of originality courage and wit formed by a unique mixture of american and french influences
thomson was born in kansas city in # studied at harvard and then mostly lived in paris until #
his missouri childhood gave him access to baptist hymns and church music but at harvard he was introduced to the writings of gertrude stein and the music of erik satie
these influences laid the foundations for the blend of the naive and the sophisticated which is the hallmark of thomson's maturity
like many young american composers he studied with nadia boulanger but after # set out to achieve the discipline of spontaneity which he found in stein's writings
when he collaborated directly with her in opera the result was of historical significance
first came four saints in three acts produced in # and then the mother of us all # which demonstrated a new kind of plotless opera only now reaching a wider currency through the stage works of philip glass
in four saints thomson's informality was given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then when it stuck wrote it down to a figured bass
he said i had wondered whether a piece so drenched in anglican chant running from gilbert and sullivan to morning prayer and back could rise and sail 
but the resulting mixture of hymns folksy tunes and recitatives at times of intoxicating banality was a sensation 
the opera like gershwin's porgy and bess the following year used an all-black cast and the staging and choreography gave it a british connection since it was by frederick ashton
the mother of us all shows more continuity but again much depends upon production in what is still a largely non-narrative opera
in # three years before aaron copland thomson started writing film scores which were a model of unobtrusive clarity and pertinence combining american materials to suit documentaries such as the plow that broke the plains and the river with the musique d'ameublement approach of satie
his score for the film louisiana story was awarded the pulitzer prize in #
another response to a visual stimulus was thomson's series of musical portraits of people such as picasso and aaron copland
the first of these was written in # and they number about #
just as thomson transferred stein's literary abstraction to music so these portraits unusually employ the painter's technique of drawing the sitter from life an ideal combination of thomson's habit of immediate response with an actual subject 
the results are terse and sharply etched the best line drawings 
thomson could control words with the same fastidiousness as notes
he always felt that effective musical criticism began by being well written and he never lost his liveliness
one never quite knew what he was going to say next
he started by writing occasional articles but in # he wrote the state of music a trenchant and provocative assessment of the machinery of the musical profession at the time
from # to # he wrote regularly for the new york herald tribune and four volumes of his notices have appeared in book form 
he wrote a fulsome #-page autobiography characteristically entitled virgil thomson on virgil thomson and a personal survey american music since # appeared in # followed recently by a selected edition of his letters
as both composer and critic he touched both sides of the coin a climate of receptivity is what the artist most desires
it is also a thing that even the most experienced reviewer cannot always offer
thomson's judgements about music were not always as accurate as his confident expression implied he invited discussion
above all he restored the focus of music criticism onto the music itself
he made no secret of his francophile enthusiasms in reaction to the earlier domination of american music by germans and he was one of the first writers to register the importance of jazz
he fearlessly attacked convention which caused problems when he pitched into established reputations
it has become increasingly apparent that thomson belonged to the american experimental tradition
he anticipated some of the enthusiasms of john cage whom he first met in #
a few years later thomson recognised cage as the most original composer in america if not the world and cage repaid the compliment by writing the works section of a monograph on thomson
but finally in spite of their common roots in satie and stein thomson felt that cage's aesthetic was destructive 
thomson's songs contain some of his finest work
there are stein settings such as portrait of fb but also cycles such as five songs from william blake prayers and praises and a cantata based on poems by edward lear
thomson was also prolific in instrumental music on both chamber and solo scale 
for many years thomson lived in new york in his apartment at the chelsea hotel
from there a buzzard in its eyrie he would make forays round the us and abroad in spite of his advanced age
he seemed a genial and indestructible landmark in the history of american music in spite of defective hearing which had bothered him since the late seventies
he had a photograph of himself on his postcards and he signed his letters following the original tailpiece everbest
thomson came from a generation of american composers which had to find its own way without benefit of university patronage
in that kind of free market he thrived and survived and so will the best of his work
obituary thomas keller
by hugh matheson
thomi keller is the outstanding figure in the history of international rowing
he was president of fisa federation internationale des societes d'aviron the world governing body for # years and most of this body's attitudes and practices reflect the force of his strict but genial personality
most athletes first encountered him as a voice bellowing in multi-lingual fury at officials who had broken rules or arrangements designed to make racing safer or more fair 
he was elected to succeed gaston mullegg as president of fisa when he was # and still competing in the swiss rowing team
he did not loosen his links with the athletes when projected upwards into the presidency
provided their behaviour was sportsmanlike and safe oarsmen found only encouragement and humour from a president who was always among them
keller's zurich upbringing made him into a skiier and sculler and he raced for the grasshopper club
he competed for the swiss cross-country and ski-jumping team at the student winter games and later concentrated on single sculls
in # he was swiss sculls champion and finished third in the european championships before moving to manila to work for his family's private multinational company eduard keller ltd for four years
on his return keller was swiss champion again in # and was bitterly disappointed when the swiss chose to boycott the # olympics after the russian intervention in hungary
fisa was then a relatively unimportant body which organised european and other championships and participated in the running of olympic regattas
as a rich forceful young man keller had been earmarked as a likely future president even before mullegg was killed in an aircrash in #
rowing was transformed in the breadth and depth of participation over the # years of his term
he sat on the appropriate boards of the international olympic committee and was president of the general assembly of international sports federations for # years
these positions were not held for his own status but to promote the cause of rowing where it needed clout
he successfully defended rowing as an olympic sport and in # introduced women's events which have now expanded to six classes
his personal preference for sculling over rowing assisted the introduction of quadruple sculls to world championship and olympic competition
keller was made a steward of henley royal regatta in # a time when the proliferation of new six-lane still-water courses around the world which had emerged under his guidance seemed a threat to the regatta founded in #
but it was the spirit of henley with huge crowds enjoying amateur sport presented with administrative finesse which keller took as the yardstick for the international circuit 
he loved the place and he returned every year to play an often small part as umpire of races between undistinguished clubs far below the olympic standard he was obliged to administer
he said this summer that as he gradually wound down his involvement in sport henley would be the last thing he would give up
during his term as president of fisa he gradually reduced his role in eduard keller ltd and used the company offices to provide a world headquarters for rowing
the sport is now obliged to find income from the more normal sources of television and sponsorship to replace his largely unacknowledged private patronage
in spite of his gift to the sport keller was anxious not to abuse his status as president and never went to a rowing event unless invited
because of this he had never seen the oxford and cambridge boat race until this year
he was enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the english could make a contest between two crews which would not rank in the world's top # into a bigger spectacle than the olympic final
the final task he set himself for his presidency which was due to end next year was to weed out of the regatta calendar all the rowing courses which could be made unfair by the wind
he had recently travelled from tasmania to norway in search of the perfect # metres of flat water
it was a blessing that in response to congratulations on the superb world championship regatta at bled in yugoslavia three weeks ago he was able to reply yes and best of all the conditions were fair throughout 
the labour party conference policy review throws a spanner in the whitehall machinery 
by colin hughes political correspondent
an incoming labour government would turn large areas of whitehall upside down but the party's policy review barely considers the implications of its plans for restructuring government departments
scattered through the policy review are proposals to drastically alterthe status and organisation of the department of trade and industry create two departments a department of consumer affairs and a department for legal administration create a department of environmental protection within the existing department of the environment set up a plethora of new commissions and executive agencies set up a women's ministry
those are only the most overt changes advocated in the review papers
the only department which explicitly escapes unscathed is the one which conservatives would most like to abolish the department of energy
in virtually every case the aim of causing upheaval is explicitly declared because labour's aim would be to upset the bureaucratic order it inherits 
new departments and quangos would according to the review be designed to act as irritants and antagonists within the civil service system 
but the policy review nowhere considers the overall effect of the individual changes proposed or how they might be co-ordinated 
nor does it contemplate the knock-on consequences for labour ministers of attempting to implement their programme while rebuilding the governmental machine 
the medium term industrial strategy which would form the centrepiece of labour's economic policy would according to the productive and competitive economy review group be administered by a transformed department of trade and industry
the review adds what we now seek is a dti which will have an equal if not superior status to that of the treasury
that approach would seek to knock out a keystone of civil service tradition
labour policy has long sought to challenge the treasury's dominance in government
but its last effort the department of economic affairs set up by harold wilson and headed by george brown ended in futile departmental and ministerial infighting
there would in addition be a minister for science and technology at the newly supreme dti with responsibility for determing investment in research
there is no mention in the education policy of how that might affect the department of education and science
but while the dti would override the treasury a new powerful department of consumer affairs would antagonise the dti
it would be headed by a minister of cabinet rank and act as the consumers voice with other government departments'
its remit for inter-departmental intrusion would be wide with a watching brief over government action and the ability to initiate consumer legislation
only the women's ministry would be given equal license
it would be able to require each government department to review its policies practices and existing and proposed legislation
while new departments are born and others extended one of the oldest the home office would become a shadow of its present self 
labour's proposed department for legal administration would take over responsibility for courts and tribunals court procedures organisation training and appointment of the legal profession magistracy and judiciary legal aid legal services and the sentencing council
that would leave the home office with policing penal policy and the criminal law
responsibility for the sex discrimination act the equal pay act and the equal opportunities commission would be given to the women's ministry
the concept of a minister having cabinet rank and therefore implicitly not being a member of the cabinet proper crops up again on environment
a new minister of environmental protection would operate inside the doe
that could work though it is easy to imagine conflicts of interest with the housing and planning functions of the department
more problematic will be labour's plan for the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food
the priority of maff must become food not farming the policy review says 
its main concerns would become food and the people who consume it not farming and those who produce it
but the regulatory functions over the food industry now split between maff and the department of health would transfer to a new food standards agency
that is the first of many agencies executives commissions and other quango-like bodies recommended by the review
in some cases labour's quangos merge existing ones or replace well-established bodies 
the funding of higher education would become the responsibility of one body rather than two
labour's quality commission would replace the audit commission
but there would be new regulatory commissions and consumer councils for every utility along with ombudsmen and public interest commissioners appointed by the secretary of state
there would be skills uk a locally structured training commission a fair wages commission a health technology commission a health quality commission an education standards council an independent sentencing council a children's commissioner an environmental protection executive and a social insurance fund administered by an independent commission
the labour party conference cook appeals for labour to accept electoral reform
by colin hughes and colin brown
an impassioned appeal for labour to back electoral reform was made by a leading shadow cabinet member yesterday after the national executive decided overwhelmingly to oppose a proportional representation motion
robin cook a member of the national executive and the health spokesman said that a labour government which sought to force its programme on an unwilling nation would be unsocialist
he told a labour co-ordinating committee rally that it was not enough for labour to win the next election
it would also be necessary to smash the decrepit effete constitution that allows a minority to capture power and then use it ruthlessly in the interests of the privileged few
mr cook argued that # years of thatcherism had been forced on most people who had never voted conservative and that many of those who opposed pr in the labour party wanted to use the same undemocratic power to ram socialism down the throats of a majority who didn't vote for it
advocates of the first-past-the-post system argued that it was the only way of delivering strong government mr cook said
but after # years of tory rule he had had enough of that approach to politics
labour would be acquiescing in a democratic outrage if it continued arguing that because the conservatives had got awaywith being undemocratic for so long it was now labour's turn 
mr cook also countered the argument that pr would build in a pull towards the centre ground preventing labourfrom implementing a radical programme
it seemed strange to make that argument mr cook said when it was clear the whole policy review process was designed to placate the centre ground 
i cannot honestly see that a system which would require us to compromise the morning after the election is really so morally inferior to a system which has already obliged us to compromise our policies two years before polling day
his speech however came aftera #-# vote in the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated on thursday
the four were mr cook ken livingstone john evans and clare short
mr livingstone said he was against pacts but # years of thatcherism had demonstrated the dangers of giving power to elites
however neil kinnock the labour leader and roy hattersley his deputy both opposed the motion
mr hattersley said giving disproportionate power to small minority centre parties would not improve democracy
mr kinnock said it was wrong to propose a fundamental change in the voting system for a short-term tactical vote to get rid of the thatcher government
the only way to remove the government was for labour to win the next general election
mr kinnock intends to reinforce his conviction that labour is in a position to win in his keynote speech tomorrow
party organisers want the conference to show that the party is united as never before leaving mr kinnock free for the first time to sell the policy package to voters without worrying about splits 
there is expected to be a close vote on defence but mr kinnock is confident the new policy will be affirmed today
the executive is recommending rejection of a motion calling for unilateral disarmament
it is also urging the conference to oppose a motion supported by the national union of mineworkers to commit a labour government to abolishing all nuclear power within # years
there could also be controversy over the executive's rejection of demands for the age of consent for homosexuals to be reduced to # years
pub rock pint-sized rock n rollers jim white selects the best of the london pub venues and gigs in the weeks ahead 
by jim white
general tips a general rule for pub rock patrons is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer except at finsbury park's sir george robey where an excellent music policy comes complete with a decent pint of guinness
another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage it will be a good evening
there are two types of pub rock occasions those like the one described above where the band is likely to suffer from agrophobia and those where the pub is so crowded death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out
there is no half-way house 
if it's a comfortable evening's entertainment you're after stay at home with the video
dress varies but will never be up 
who to watch while the best that chart music can manage in the way of band names is black box the pub circuit has always been ripe with imaginative handles 
cheerfully bending ears this week somewhere in london are bald howlin' bastard daisy chainsaw the wandering crutchless benny profane the gordon jackson five and new fast automatic daffodils
we have no idea whether the music matches the nomenclature but it must be worth # of anyone's money to encourage them
playing this week tonight bop brothers blues band the plethora of litigation surrounding blues brothers lookalikes almost matches that attached to the release of wired the unofficial biography of the original brother john belushi
suffice to say whether boogie bop or simply blues this set of brothers whatever they once were before they fell out and dispatched solicitors to sue their siblings will be wearing dark glasses pork pie hats black side-burns and will be playing stax atlantic type material 
can't fail to be entertaining

ripping yarns and moral minefields allan and janet talk ahlberg talk to celia dodd about their bestsellers for children
by celia dodd
these days no one questions the importance of good books for the under- 
but books that appeal to adults too are just as important we are after all the ones who have to do the reading
there are few things worse than being bludgeoned into reading a book you hate
story-reading should be one of the great joys of parenthood a real meeting of adult and child minds
with the ahlbergs' books it very often is
the husband-and-wife partnership behind such classics as the jolly postman burglar bill and the baby's catalogue win children over with ripping yarns and a wicked sense of humour
they win their parents over with a rose -tinted vision of the world which is decidedly reassuring 
their books are usually set nostalgically in the past the thirties and forties are favourite periods and often feature the perennial characters of fairy tales and nursery rhymes
yet they are saved from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and pictures
the ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh realities of life of being too cosy and sweet but their latest picture book bye bye baby published today breaks the mould 
in it a small child roams the streets talking to strangers until he finally goes off with a woman who has been wandering about pushing an empty pram
curious subject matter for a children's picture book you might think and hardly guaranteed to win the approval of the gimlet -eyed children's book world 
but the ahlbergs have no time for literal interpretations of their work
how they argue would alice or the wind in the willows stand up against such scrutiny
the way to look at bye bye baby they insist is as a light surreal comedy
certainly if you bring a literal interpretation to the story it's a minefield allan ahlberg says
bye bye baby gets away with its particular minefield thanks to the sleight of illustrator janet ahlberg's hand
the visual inspiration for the book was the famous advert for start-rite shoes showing a small boy and girl walking off down a tree-lined avenue an innocent image if ever there was one
the ahlberg version features a solitary figure
the advert gave the story its vaguely thirties setting
the success of the ahlbergs' working relationship must have a lot to do with their long and happy marriage
in spite of apparently incompatible personalities she is small and shy he is large and does most of the talking they have an empathy which is essential to the way they work a persistent mutual pestering
the strength of the partnership is highlighted for allan who also works with a number of other artists
the time-consuming nature of janet's part in the process combined with a bad back which prevents her spending more than a couple of hours at the drawing board every day means she cannot keep up with her husband's prolific output
with other illustrators i work at a distance we visit and phone but there is a point at which i can't pester them any more allan says
they see themselves not as author and illustrator with separate roles but as a partnership of book-makers contributing equally to the process
allan ahlberg says in the past a lot of children's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant framed in a gallery but when you tried to read the book there was nothing there because the words started a coat-hanger to hang pictures on 
given the importance they place on the interrelationship of words and pictures the couple's working lives are surprisingly separate
they claim to see each other less than couples who go out to work meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen
their #-year-old daughter jessica who is likely to be seen with her head buried in the beano or a roald dahl novel has provided the inspiration for many of her parents' books
as a baby she was fascinated by the mothercare catalogue and so the baby's catalogue which documents the paraphernalia of the infant's small world in minute detail was born 
allan's experience as a primary school teacher is another rich source of ideas
the couple still maintain close links with local schools where they spend hours researching sketching and absorbing jokes
after # years of teaching allan had had enough
i ran out of steam 
it's a killing job
little kids eat you alive they want so much physically and emotionally
every year he would have half a dozen nineand #-year-olds in his class who could barely read
he treated reading as a team effort getting them to read the daily mirror rather than the dull babyish books on offer
these days he writes the books intended to help children learn to read
a lot of books used in schools are technically readable but rather drab stories
there's no reason why they shouldn't be funny or gripping even if they don't use many words
writing books for children is becoming increasingly complex as the arbiters of the modern child's mores librarians teachers and publishers lay down ever more stringent criteria
the problem with children's books increasingly is that there are armies of people who are properly concerned with for example the way girls were always discriminated against in the past says allan
that is bad and must be thought about 
but people seem to think that stories are written to a prescription that you sit down and say you don't want it to be sexist you don't want it to be racist
in reality you just invent a tale you were sitting round a fire in a cave 
in fact anti-racism and anti-sexism seem to come naturally to the ahlbergs
their books are full of female breadwinners and new men changing nappies and comforting bawling babies in the small hours
although they are a principled pair they once turned down the smarties award on moral grounds the ahlbergs reject the notion of children's author as moralist
i would say just sit down and tell a good story and to hell with the morality allan ahlberg declares
with that characteristically strong statement he puts his finger on the secret of the ahlbergs' phenomenal success with adults and children alike
the revolution the countryside needs christian wolmar says britain is lagging behind in setting up telecottages
by christian wolmar
the information technology revolution has left large swaths of rural britain untouched 
the only computers in many villages are those owned by the teenage boys of the affluent to play their wham-bam games
ashley dobbs an engaging young entrepreneur is setting out to change that by creating a nationwide network of telecottages
this clever name with its neat evocation of new and old describes a concept which was developed in sweden and is spreading to rural areas across the world
in mr dobbs's words a telecottage is a room in a village filled with computer communications that can be used by local people to learn and work
the equipment consists of perhaps four word processors a modem a laser printer able to produce artwork-quality output a fax and a photocopier
software programmes for desk-top publishing word processing accounting and business planning are also essential
mr dobbs who is chairman of telecottages uk warns possible users not to get bogged down with the technology the equipment is a tool to overcome what needs to be done
people mustn't think that because there's a computer they've got to think of a use for it
he reckons there are no shortages of possible uses farmers can use it to do their accounts women with child-care responsibilities can work in their own time on the word processors publicity material for local craftsmen can be produced and so on
this may sound utopian but it has been borne out by the experience of existing telecottages
so far about # have been established mainly in scandinavia but also in japan and several third world countries
as the network expands so do the uses 
the first was opened in the village of vemdalen in the remote forests of sweden in september #
the impact according to henning albrechsten president of telecottages international who has been involved in their development since the outset was immediate 
by holding open meetings for children and having the telecottage above the local store people of all walks of life came in small-scale entrepreneurs and their spouses shop assistants craftspeople and children
now # per cent of the village regularly uses telecottage and at least # per cent has taken courses there 
britain is lagging behind 
no telecottages have been established but there are several initiatives in the offing
the most advanced is a plan for five in the north of scotland which will be funded by the highlands and islands development board and british telecom
colin pavey of british telecom hopes that they will be running by the end of the year
two would be business and three would be community-orientated and located in schools
we are most interested in the idea of networking sharing skills such as translation and using them for distance learning
telephone cables in the region are being upgraded to ensure they are capable of handling faxes
mr dobbs's more unlikely allies are the women's institutes
most of the workers in telecottages and many of the users are women
he says in villages there are many women with skills who aren't using them because of child-care problems
but they are interested in working
users of telecottages are given the key and people can use them at any time which means that women can come in during the evening early in the morning or whatever
he is working on a scheme with the national federation of wi to organise a competition to celebrate next year's #th anniversary by offering # telecottages as prizes for its # branches and he is hoping the wi will establish a pilot telecottage near its college in denman oxfordshire
while telecottages should become self-financing once established they do need initial subsidy
the cost of providing the start-up equipment is in the order of # and mr dobbs thinks space is not much of a problem there's usually the village hall or an empty shop
henning albrechsten reckons that it takes three years for a telecottage to be able to function without subsidy
in scandinavia with their mixed economies money is always available after a bit of persuasion from both local and central government
in britain the tight financial regime imposed on local councils and the reluctance of central government to take on any new expenditure makes it necessary to seek funds from the private sector 
the only government support so far has been a recommendation by the rural development commission part of the department of the environment to establish a pilot scheme
mr dobbs sighs this is a typically british bureaucratic response 
it's been proved elsewhere that they work 
we don't need pilots we need telecottages
as for the private sector while bt may be happy to provide pump priming for five telecottages in the north of scotland it is not about to bankroll a nationwide network
nor it seems is anyone else
there is more at stake here than just bringing boxes of sophisticated equipment to remote areas
as mr dobbs who runs a country house restoration business from his home in micheldever hampshire says villages are good places to live and work
the village is a fantastic institution and they make people happier
but the villages are dying becoming suburbs or dormitories where few people work but many sleep 
employment in agriculture still the main rural industry fell from over a million in the mid-sixties to under # now
the aim of telecottages is to create well-paid flexible employment which will provide new jobs and make existing rural industries more competitive
the emphasis on high wages is important
villages are expensive to live in and if they are to become vibrant communities again local people must be able to earn enough to be able to continue living in them
there is a wider impact too
the abstract talk of commuting by rail or road being replaced by information technology finds a concrete expression in the idea of telecottages
once people overcome their fears about computers and begin to use them in telecottages they acquire their own equipment
many may eventually be able to work from home rather than commute to an office
henning albrechsten says modern information technology has given people in remote regions the opportunity to overcome their worst handicap their distance from the centres of learning and development
he sees them as not only strengthening small communities but also as actually beginning to reverse the population flows from the countryside to the towns
britain with its growing traffic problems seems an ideal place for the onset of this revolution 
despite mr dobbs's tireless efforts this is another revolution which britain is likely to be viewing from the sidelines 
rugby union welsh horizon all turns black 
by steve bale
each new indignity in the heap visited on welsh rugby seems worse than the last
the selectors knew they were playing with fire when they decided to arrange a couple of club fixtures and they have duly been consumed in a conflagration of their own making 
the new zealanders appropriately garbed in funereal black arrive next week to scatter the ashes 
on and off the field the national game of the land of song is in a discordant mess 
losing was one thing but to lose as spinelessly as the welsh xv did to bridgend on saturday was to add insult to severely injured pride
in all honesty we should have won by at least # points brian nicholas the bridgend coach said
as if #-# and derisive chants of easy easy were not bad enough this humiliation was against a side who have made a wretched start to the season a week earlier pontypool had given them a #-# going over and were short of at least half first-choice players
four of the absentees suffered the squirming discomfort of being among the welsh squad 
it's not that i don't want to say anything but i just don't know what to say john ryan the welsh coach sighed
his plans in ruins he is now reduced micawber to hoping something will turn up before his players face the all blacks in five short weeks
at bridgend he looked in despair and he almost admitted as much i hope we can pull it together but sometimes i have my doubts
nicholas was sympathetic he is only as good as the players we give him
but another selector confided the truth that wales should be giving club opposition a hammering and at half building on their win over newbridge it looked as if they would
they had weathered bridgend's early fury conceding a try before coming back with some confidence to score three of their own
but wales were having us on 
from the comparative opulence of #-# they then slipped into penury by conceding # unanswered points 
bridgend raised their game against wales now wales must do precisely the same against new zealand
no one who was at the brewery field perhaps not even the selectors would give twopence for their ability to do so
the backs were mainly pedestrian but the fundamental problem lay elsewhere 
apart from kevin moseley's steady supply from the line-out there was nothing much to commend in a welsh forward effort which reverted to the very worst eighties stereotype of static cumbersome donkeys only too willing to slow the game to walking pace
when the pressure comes on players revert to bad habits ryan said
the all blacks would treat such an outmoded approach with the scorn it deserves although on the other hand they might have been impressed with bridgend's contrasting mobility and aggression 
the back row were swifter to the loose ball had a clearer idea of what to do with it when they got there and their impressive half-backs were given every opportunity which they eagerly took to control the game
this was conveniently encapsulated in the first try
wales characteristically delayed the heel at a scrum putting robert jones in trouble when the ball finally emerged
he was scraggedby mike budd jeremy cooper came away with the ball owain williams acted as the link and kevin ellis scored three back-row forwards and their scrum-half in perfect harmony 
wales's instant reaction a try by arthur emyr and subsequent steady improvement bringing well-crafted tries for emyr and robert jones promised more than was later fulfilled
in the third quarter bridgend had little difficulty in wiping out an #-point deficit huw bevan supporting aled williams's break for their second try
it was a magnificent fightback and such was welsh distress that they never looked like preventing it
we have taken a step backward ryan said and on this sorry evidence it looks as if it will be backwards all the way when the test takes place at cardiff arms park on # november
as the welsh squad do not meet again until # october time has all but run out 
football hazard hints at the missing gifts 
by patrick barclay
how to describe saturday's match between chelsea and arsenal
well i seem to recall a london gallery exhibiting a pileof rubbish which was considered valid art by the proprietors and drew a large attendance
the only redeeming feature of a goalless worthless event at stamford bridge was that it did not require a grant
yet the chelsea manager bobby campbell and arsenal assistant theo foley agreed it had been a good match and the spectators' complaints were muted 
some even applauded the players at the end 
it takes all sorts
bobby robson was there to assess world cup candidates but nothing positive emerged from # minutes of scuffling that made one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of rangers' european cup exit in munich three days earlier
at least the outcome was appropriate
had either of the teams won they would have taken the league leadership 
instead liverpool stayed top without kicking a ball
television had postponed manchester united's scheduled visit to anfield so it could be shown live on # december the longest night
london's leading pair as if piqued by this turned # september into the longest afternoon
on and on it dragged 
lacking a goal that might have altered its chemistry it remained a matter of dull physics 
yet many of the crowd were kept interested by the possibility of victory which is i suppose what derbies are about 
they are so frequent these days in london which has eight of # first division clubs that we must expect aesthetic considerations to be overridden
why though could these supposed championship contenders not have tried to emulate the fine passing that had sprinkled the previous weekend's merseyside joust 
the simple answer is that chelsea are in a false position and arsenal on this evidence slightly jaded champions
they ought to have pocketed three points in the first half but tony adams a more threatening centre-forward on his forays than the current alan smith missed the target with two headers and david rocastle let dave beasant save a penalty much as the stretch keeper had done for wimbledon in the # fa cup final
now an arsenal team in peak health would have kept a grip on the match
this one could not
as george graham indicated upon his side's accession to the title they would need more composure and sophistication to match liverpool in the longer term
he chose not to hasten the process by buying
after all he had just the man on his staff
but paul davis remains unfit
his absence is increasingly conspicuous and liverpool for the moment in a super league of one
davis of course would have walked into england's team in poland a week on wednesday until last season's prolonged suspension followed by injury bobby robson had him firmly pencilled in as bryan robson's replacement
michael thomas several years younger is not quite in the same class yet but may have to play in chorzow
if so it will be a gamble because he flopped on his only previous international appearance in saudi arabia
the odds are favourable enough according to chelsea's mike hazard who said of his adversary he could cope in poland not just because of his ability to close people down and use the ball well but temperament you saw when he scored the goal that won arsenal the league
very kind but international players are supposed to be habitually influential and it was hazard who in the second half with a few incisive passes gifts from the heavens on a day like this left a greater mark 
chelsea might have won had the ball not kept turning into a mexican bean at kerry dixon's feet
campbell's hard-working side are still trying to sort out their system which involves a spare defender and as far as one can see a good deal of improvisation
it should suit tony dorigo the unblooded england left-back though oddly his rival nigel winterburn did more rampaging on saturday neither in truth made the heart pound 
dorigo at least had the satisfaction of seeing his direct opponent and england colleague david rocastle withdrawn 
all in all bobby robson must have found it about as fruitful as a day trying to get in touch with brian clough
there was however one aspect that deserves commendation
after # minutes graham roberts was injured by a tackle for which perry groves was booked steve clarke took over as sweeper and is likely to have several weeks in which to build on a promising display 
roberts's ankle appeared broken but the chelsea players were not interested in retribution and the club as soon as they knew the injury was less serious put a message on the electronic scoreboard an example of public relations from which others could learn
pope rejects runcie's vision of church leadership
from andrew brown religious affairs correspondent in rome
the archbishop of canterbury dr robert runcie exchanged a symbolic kiss of peace with pope john paul ii yesterday at a mass attended by thousands in st peter's square rome
but dr runcie's ideas of a limited primacy recognising the pope as a central figure in the christian church who would exercise a primacy for the sake of unity and mission have been rejected as insufficient by the pope
they have also aroused protestant anger against dr runcie at the same time as he has become involved in a row over his attack on the pharisees of british society
though dr runcie and his party could not take holy communion at the papal mass he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the anglican church in rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpit the visit has been dogged by protests from supporters of the rev ian paisley
in his sermon dr runcie said we should ever recognise the scandal that anglicans and roman catholics must celebrate two eucharists to make one memorial of our redemption on the day of our lord 
dr runcie has gone out of his way on this visit to concede many of the doctrinal points and practices which large elements of the church of england have traditionally found offensive in roman catholicism
the pope too has spoken warmly of unity
on saturday the two prelates attended a service of vespers at the church of san gregorio which stands on the site where pope gregory sent st augustine of canterbury off to become the first archbishop of canterbury in #
but in their prepared homilies the pope and the archbishop addressed quite different problems
dr runcie repeated his offer of a limited primacy involving the limited powers exercised by the popes in the first few centuries of the christian church
however the pope's account of the role of the papacy went a great deal farther than that christian unity he said must be founded on the faith in christ that was handed on by the apostles what this faith is must be determined by the roman catholic church
he quoted the second vatican council the task of giving an authentic interpretation of the word of god has been entrusted to the living teachting office of the church alone 
the specific role of bishops which is to be exercised in communion with the see of peter in ensuring the unity and continuity of the faith is vital if we are to hand on the faith of peter gregory and augustine
all our efforts to restore unity among christians will be in vain if they are not carried out in total fidelity to the faith in christ handed on by the apostles
in a statement afterwards dr runcie stressed that he was not proposing any change in the british constitution 
the phrase universal primacy has a spiritual meaning
it does not imply political supremacy and does not suggest that the pope should administer the affairs of the church of england he said
both prelates referred to the consecration in february of the rt rev barbara harris as the anglican assistant bishop of massachussetts
bishop harris is quite unacceptable to the vatican
the pope said events in recent years have seriously aggravated the differences between us
the independent has learnt that # american roman catholic nuns wrote last winter to dr runcie urging him to defy the pope over the ordination of women
sister margaret traxler of the national coalition of american nuns said that she had told dr runcie the roman catholic church says this is a deterrent to unity but we say how can this be a deterrent to unity when discrimination against women is evil 
she said she had received a friendly and brotherly reply from dr runcie
labour would keep tight rein on spending
by anthony bevins political editor
john smith the shadow chancellor yesterday set the overriding tone for this week's labour party conference with a warning that he would impose tough spending controls if labour won the next election
his warning casts doubt on labour's commitment to increase spending on priority programmes for the health service and pensions
mr smith said in an interview on bbc television's on the record that he did not expect his colleagues to spend and spend again' when they took office
he conceded that there would be disputes with colleagues but said there are no quick fixes and i will not be indulging in any quick fix 
a quick fix clearly becomes unfixed 
there are realities that i cannot change 
there will be the reality of the economic situation which we inherit which will not be our fault but it will be our responsibility
when we've got an economic mess the first duty of a government is to clear up the economic mess 
now if that means we have to postpone some of our social ambitions then we may have to do so
but it will not mean that we are abandoning them
we will tackle putting our economy in order so that we can achieve that social ambition so that the strong economy is used to finance and develop the fair society
as for his colleagues mr smith said we're all agreed that we cannot spend what we have not earned and we intend to earn it before we spend it
that will be the guiding light of the next labour government
when i insist on that priority as i can tell you i most certainly will with the full support of the prime minister in doing so then i'm sure my colleagues will see the point of that 
now it is quite right of them of course to allow our social obligations not to be forgotten there'll probably be an argument
there are in all governments between the treasury and spending ministers
but they will take into account the need for that balance that says that social spending without underpinning by economic growth will not be sustained in any event
mr smith's warning coincided with a call by ken livingstone the labour mp for brent east who said on london weekend television's the walden interview you can be miles ahead in the polls but when you get to the last three weeks people think can i afford a labour government
we need to say now what we are going to spend where the money is going to come from 
mr livingstone called for cuts in defence spending
david blunkett another member of the national executive told a conference fringe rally organised by the soft labour coordinating committee that labour would have to find additional funds for its social programme by cutting #bn from defence spending over five years and raising the level of taxation on the rich
the policy review's top rate of income tax # per cent was too low he said
although the policy review will be endorsed by the conference giving neil kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the conservatives in the run-up to the next general election there are a number of areas of potential conflict
calls for consideration of electoral reform and a new form of black representation are both expected to be defeated 
ron todd the general secretary of the transport workers' union said that today's vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the massive and overwhelming majority predicted by right-wingers and he warned that party leaders could not expect everybody to goose-step in the same direction once the policy had been carried 
the conference opened with labour buoyed by a series of weekend opinion polls giving leads of from # to # points 
an atmosphere poisoned by mistrust
by nicholas roe
the disposal of toxic wastes is one of the most intractable problems facing industrialised societies
even though some of the most dangerous and persistent toxins including polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are no longer manufactured quantities of them still exist and must be got rid of
but how
and where
on this page nick roe visits a plant which despite strenuous public relations efforts has failed to convince its neighbours that it has come clean 
and richard north looks at current provisions for the destruction of pcbs and at the history of british involvement in a rather uncomfortable growth industry the security guard at the entrance to one of britain's mightiest hazardous waste disposal plants pressed a button and the gate opened
then he pressed another knob and a big toy doll in his office window dropped its trousers
you had to laugh
yet this was rechem international's high incineration plant at pontypool in gwent south wales
hardly a laughing matter surely
beyond the barrier lay some of the most toxic chemicals known awaiting destruction by fire
what else
a vast smoke-blackened furnace # people to do the work massive investment the company spent #m last year on cleaning up smoke emissions
plus a backdrop of houses covering the valley walls on either side a reminder that wherever industrialised societies decide to deal with their most intractable problems they are unlikely to find a place to do so which is not in somebody's back yard 
britain grinds out almost five million tonnes of hazardous waste each year of which about # tonnes are so difficult to store or treat that they are burnt at high temperatures here in gwent or at one of three other centres ellesmere port fawley near southampton and the unfortunately named killamarsh near sheffield
five more incinerators currently proposed in various parts of the country will double capacity
then there are the imports # tonnes of toxic waste enter british ports annually for incineration or other treatment a figure which has increased #-fold in just eight years
in these environmentally conscious times this is an uncomfortable growth industry
liverpool dockers recently turned back parts of a #-tonne consignment of canadian pcbs polychlorinated biphenyls bound for this plant in gwent
in doing so they underlined a fact which is likely to attract more and more attention as tankers continue to shift toxins from town to town country to country the waste chain is long 
it snakes in and out of ports along our busiest highways and through our most crowded cities
anxieties which are currently felt most acutely by those living near destruction plants themselves may not always remain so localised
at pontypool the collision between a precise scientific industry and a diffuse unscientific local suspicion is painfully apparent
local people mutter and march make speeches and throw things staff face sarcasm in nearby pubs and for years there have been demands for a public inquiry
rechem has responded with a rather desperate open-door policy aimed at soothing fears and more recently by issuing about a dozen writs against the fiercest critics
we are an aggressive company admitted david wheeler operations director at this plant and at rechem's other incinerator at fawley
for a place so hated the pontypool plant looks innocuous inside like a cross between an oil refinery and a crematorium
mr wheeler an engineer who worked for many years in the oil business is a pleasant slightly worried-looking man who cannot bear the fact that no one seems to realise just what lengths he goes to in order to keep the plant squeaky clean and emission-free 
in hard hats and protective glasses we walked past the huge fume cupboard where the most noxious barrels are opened and arrived at the vast closed mouth of the furnace itself
it was hot but not burning
there was a fault on the computer governing the plant said mr wheeler and the fire had automatically shut down 
these pipes stretching thinly in a bridge across the service road injected a mix of chemicals into the walls of the furnace itself did i know that fuel was only used in the start-up process after which the chemicals themselves provided the fire
workers in blue overalls drifted around us and cracked jokes in gentle welsh accents 
in the furnace control office i found shift foreman keith thomas and asked innocently if he had any physical problems not since my vasectomy
a grin
he lived locally so how did neighbours view his job here
you get sarcasm mainly
a lot of my friends are pleased that the company is doing the job they are doing 
others are not so well informed
you couldn't hope to convert them
at a nearby house leonard hough a retired schoolmaster had earlier told me about the fog which he says comes from the factory
it blows along the valley
they've improved the chimney recently and it's very much better than it was but we still get the smells
and since they've refused repeatedly to have a public inquiry into what is going on there we're not certain of the safety of what's coming out
we get smoke from the steel works across the valley but we know what that is and we're not afraid of it
keith thomas pressed a button and a huge door clanked upwards so that i could peer into the heart of the furnace
piles of ruddy-brown ash lay heaped on the floor
pumps sucked air inwards
heat shone out
in here they burn about # tonnes of chemicals a year a quarter originating outside britain
the waste arrives at the rate of up to seven tanker-loads every day that is seven lorries passing thousands of doorsteps
right here in this gaping mouth lies the end of the chain 
the wastes include lindane ddt out-of-date drugs carcinogenic chemicals old cigars and even pornography a different kind of pollution 
about # tonnes of the total waste is pcb-contaminated
pcbs are so difficult to destroy that rechem's emission-monitoring systems are geared to detecting them on the grounds that if you destroy pcbs you destroy everything
this of course is a key point 
if you did not burn chemicals like pcbs what else would you do with them
the sea
the earth
we are not in the business of polluting the environment mr wheeler insisted
we are on the side of the angels 
environmental organisations however put the emphasis elsewhere 
there is no incinerator which completely destroys toxic wastes madeleine cobbing greenpeace's toxics campaigner told me
the crux of our argument is that we don't need to have toxic wastes and the fact that plants like rechem exist providing easy options for companies is acting as a disincentive for companies to clean up 
but another but what about the pcbs that already exist
although they are no longer manufactured they are still present for example in electrical equipment
no one could therefore call for the closure of incineration plants at a stroke because noxious chemicals have to go somewhere
so a part of the argument switches to the kind of incinerators you allow while industry is forced to clean itself up 
also how these should function and perhaps most important of all where you put them
mr wheeler now moving to the rear of the plant to show off the #m smoke-cleaning section which had just broken down pointed out that his company achieved destruction of at least # per cent of all materials
the company's figures imply that when you have burnt # per cent of a #-tonne annual throughput a figure of # of a tonne remains 
in # according to friends of the earth a survey of the homes clustered on the surrounding hills found that three-quarters of # residents were opposed to the rechem plant 
the plant should be relocated because it's in the wrong place llew smith the local euro-mp told me
it is in a valley and in a highly populated area
what did mr wheeler make of that 
if we do it properly any spot is the right spot he insisted
stack emissions of pcbs were below the american standard for breathing air # times lower than the british equivalent
regular soil and grass tests showed no difference between pcb contamination in the immediate area and elsewhere in wales though there are no established safe levels for these 
five air-monitoring plants had been installed he tookme to see them
and here were drumsof chemicals each labelled each with a job number to check against sampling
and yet there are accidents
in # aluminium melted in the furnace reacted with water and exploded sending a black cloud over nearby houses
later drumssupposedly containing carcinogenic drugs were not opened for checking before burning for health reasons and three were misdescribed 
they too reacted with water and a plant operator was burned by a cloud of acid gas
we walked past a tanker where a huge man named andy matthews was pumping vinyl acetate into a #-gallon vat wreathed in its sweet sickly smell i've been here two years he said
my father was an industrial chemist and he said if you want to go and work for them go and work for them
were there any spillages
he shrugged
nothing major
i might drop a pipe a little bit of a splash
in a large prefabricated shed we wandered past stacks of #-gallon drums of pcbs two drums high about # deep and there were contaminated transformers waiting to be cut up and roasted in the flames
back along the waste chain the liverpool dockers who objected to the import of exactly this type of chemical should be aware that pcbs are moving about our roads all the time
there was no difference between the liquid in these drums and the liquid in the cargoes they refused to touch
in liverpool a dockers' spokesman with the transport and general workers union admitted drivers aren't happy handling some of these commodities but at least a lorry-driver has more idea of what he is handling than a docker who could have a consignment and just not know what it is
yet he did not oppose all toxic waste movement after all the same union represents workers at rechem itself he simply didn't like the idea that big industrial nations like canada could dump their dirty problems on this country and his members 
driving away i noticed that the vast chimney was still not functioning but when i called at a neighbouring house a woman showed me videos she had taken of smoke coming from the plant settling in her garden
certainly the incinerator seems well controlled
certainly there is no scientific evidence that living nearby increases the risk of sickness
certainly mr wheeler convinced me that his company was going to huge lengths to keep itself clean
we must run it safely in the short term and long term he said because if people are able to demonstrate that we are causing an environment problem we will be shut down 
in april # a tanker spilled # litres of pcbs over the main trans-canada highway on the border between ontario and manitoba
a section of the road was shut for a week and motorists were warned to clean their cars and to dispose of the rags in plastic bags
health update crack connection with aids
by olivia timbs
there is much concern in the us about the addiction to crack purified cocaine within inner-city communities 
 doctorsare worried that women turning to prostitution to finance the habit are at risk of contracting aids
this problem has spread to the uk
in the past two months doctors at the regional addiction treatment unit in birmingham have come across five patients addicted to crack
three are prostitutes introduced to the drug by pimps
according to them crack is widely available in birmingham and most prostitutes they know use it daily
the doctors point out in the british medical journal that though crack dependency is not a direct risk factor for aids prostitutes trying to maintain expensive crack habits may be tempted into unsafe sex practices which in turn may lead to an increase in the spread of aids
health update zinc deficiency in pregnancy
by olivia timbs
fads for vitamin supplements have been overtaken by a vogue for minerals and trace elements
zinc is the latest lack of it supposedly causes a range of problems although little scientific evidence supports the link 
but some reports have suggested that low zinc levels may lead to problems in pregnancy from difficult labour to congenital malformations in children
there is stronger evidence that a zinc deficiency may cause the foetus to grow slowly in the womb
doctors in bristol decided to test the theory
in a study of nearly # women they found that zinc supplements did not improve either foetal health or reduce the number of pre-term labours
the doctors conclude in the british medical journal that there would be little benefit if all women in the uk were given zinc supplements during pregnancy
they recognise however that the women in their study were largely middle-class who might well have sufficiently large zinc stores because they were well nourished
further studies the researchers believe should concentrate on pregnant women known to have a zinc deficiency or to be at risk from problems during labour
health alternative cures not proven
by olivia timbs
renee henry underwent a lumpectomy and radiotherapy for her breast cancer
dr maurice slevin a consultant physician at the department of medical oncology at st bartholomew's hospital london said the chances of a woman being alive and well four years after such treatment were at least # per cent
mrs henry refused the drug treatmentgiven to reduce the chances of a relapse but there are many who would remain well without it dr slevin said
part of the attraction of alternative cancer treatments such as the gerson therapy is that they allow a patient to feel more in control of the treatment 
dr slevin agreed that this is often beneficial but is concerned about other aspects of such therapies
very few have been evaluated and the evidence is largely anecdotal he said
some of the treatments have dramatic side-effects
if they do work that is wonderful but we have no way of knowing for sure
there have been no controlled trials of the gerson therapy
if one of my patients wants to give up a potentially curative treatment in favour of an alternative therapy then i will try to dissuade them
but it is essentially up to the patient
he said the nhs should address itself more to the needs of cancer patients so that they do not feel they have to go outside the system 
they should be offered relaxation therapy and stress management and advice on diet and exercise he said
the imperial cancer research fund and the cancer research campaign are conducting a joint study of the bristol cancer help centre which offers a holistic programme dietary advice and emotional counselling to complement medical treatment
media return of the six-gun saga modern actors cannot ride and young viewers do not understand the cowboy code but a revival of the western looms on the horizon john lichfield says
by john lichfield
where are the tv westerns of yesteryear
what happened to ben cartwright hoss and little joe
where is the wagon train that seemed permanently to be circlingits wagons waiting for a drunken pioneer's wife to have twins in the last of them
the tv western seemed to fade into the sunset some time in the mid-# victim of a narcissistic age that preferred to look at prosperous smart-alecky or violent images of itself dallas cheers miami vice
it was a time when children were encouraged to fantasize about machines and outer space rather than marvel at the open spaces where the deer and buffalo roamed
now however it seems the wheel has turned full circle 
the western is being revived reinterpreted for the #
one of the most successful hollywood tv producers david jacobs the creator of dallas believes the western also fell victim to late # iconoclasm
the john wayne stereotype was rejected along with his conservative values he said
a series of spoof or obsessively realistic # westerns cat balou butch cassidy and the sundance kid soldier blue the wild bunch stripped the mask from the lone ranger's face
the legend could not be taken seriously any longer in what had been admittedly a threadbare form 
howard rosenberg tv critic of the los angeles times said just look at the re-runs of the old western series
you had heroes scotch-taped to their horses and lightly sprinkled with dust
you can't get away with that any more
john mantley producer of gunsmoke for cbs for # years says elements of the old story began to fall apart 
we all read bury my heart at wounded knee
we knew that the us government had signed # treaties with the indians and broken every one
a part of the myth just didn't work after that 
at their peak in the mid-# there were # western series on the three american tv networks almost two a day on each channel 
in the us weekly audience ratings in # there were three westerns in the top five and seven in the top #
by the mid-# they had all gone the way of the buffalo extinct save for preservation in the national park of permanent re-runs
gene autry the first tv cowboy now # says westerns dominated the early days of tv partly because they had lively cheaply produced visuals but mainly because early tv was starved of feature films by the studios
westerns were a handy substitute 
there are encouraging signs however that the tv western is struggling back into the saddle 
paradise launched on cbs last season and shown on bbc# this summer was the first new western serial for a decade
it was the only new drama series in us network tv to be allowed a second series this year despite a relatively lowly #th ranking in the ratings
its creator and executive producer is perhaps surprisingly david jacobs
why did he follow j r ewing the epitome of # tv with a western about a gunfighter turned foster father
i believed the genre was still an important and powerful one
it's something i've always had an affection for
i found it was possible with paradise to talk about individual and personal responsibility something which if set in a contemporary context would have had a preachy feel about it
lonesome dove a five-part story of a texas-to-montana cattle drive also shown on cbs last year was the best-watched tv mini-series of any kind in america for five years
it won substantial critical acclaim and will show in britain next year
the #-# season which started this month brought another new prime-time western series abc's young riders which tells the story of the pony express
it also says a lot about modern american tv
because the networks believe westerns appeal mainly to middle-aged men young riders has a cast of five pouting young male actors in an attempt to make a western with good demographics
the effect is rather an extended advertisement for marlboro lights 
westerns are no longer a cheap option
the classic western tv series were filmed in back-lots or in the semi-desert # miles from los angeles
modern audiences no longer accept plastic bushes and the southern californian suburban sprawl means the production companies have to take their horses and cows to locations far away in arizona or montana
david jacobs also points out that the cost of hiring a stage-coach is now prohibitive
at one time there were dozens of companies which specialised in renting out western paraphernalia
now there are maybe two
the cost has gone through the barn roof 
and actors can no longer ride
they have to be sent to cowboy school
westerns by their nature demand more time on location
as a result mr jacobs says it cost nearly as much to make an episode of paradise with relatively unknown actors as an episode of dallas with its big stars 
will the western ride again
john mantley is cautious
westerns have a gladiatorial timeless quality
on the other hand you have a whole generation of tv watchers that doesn't really know the rules 
a western is like a japanese noh play
it is a stylised drama with understated dialogue that depends on recognition of key words and concepts
many of the young people today have n't the first idea of what's going on 
in the inert # the western represented a troubled adventurous american past
in the anxious and eventful late # and # they may come to represent like all creatures great and small in britain a less confusing past with simpler deeper values 
maybe
on the other hand the young riders came #t in the ratings in its first week trailing far far behind all the modern myths about modern times such as the cosby show roseanne golden girls cheers and matlock
it is premature then to say that the western has galloped back to centre screen
but there is a puff of dust on the horizon 
law always take along a friend to sue litigation can pay off even in the unlikeliest circumstances
stephen gold explains
by stephen gold
when things go wrong you can sue more often than you may think
money may not have changed hands 
someone may have even done you a favour
it doesn't matter
as long as you can show that they owed you a legal duty to be careful and have been negligent damagescould come your way 
there are a numberof points to bear in mind
take up references before giving credit lending money letting in tenants taking on staff
ask banks building societies former landlords present and past employers
if you rely to your detriment on a misleading reference which was given negligently you should be able to sue the referee
the subject of a bad reference can sue the referee for libel but has to show the referee was up to no good spite ill or some improper motive will do 
take along a prosperous adviser on all shopping sprees demonstrate a high degree of trust and strong reliance in what they say and you may have unexpected protection should the seller go out of business and the goods fall to pieces 
a #-year-old woman accountant who knew nothing about the mechanical side of vehicles asked her more knowledgeable friend to find a car for her
she stipulated that it must never have been involved in an accident
the friend found one ata garage
although he failed to check it had been accident-free he assured the lady that this was the case
she bought it
it had been in an accident and it was worthless
in may last year the court of appeal upheld a judgment against the friend for more than # damages for negligence because he had owed the accountant a duty of care
your conservatory collapses as a result of negligence of the professionals who were engaged by the previous owner to put it up
you can sue the professionals builders architects surveyors or engineers by courtesy of the defective premises act # despite the fact that you never had a contract with them yourself
there are strict time limits generally six years from when damage first occurred where the damage was initially latent you are given longer three years from when you could have discoveredit with a long stop of # years
it may also be possible to claim damages against a local authority for negligently failing to ensure that construction work complied with the relevant building regulations
a solicitor fails to draw up a will within a reasonable time for a client who subsequently dies
you lose the gift which the will would have made 
you can sue the solicitor for what you would have collected had he done his job properly because the law reckons he owed you as well as his client a duty of care
when you want to borrow on a mortgage the prospective lenders will have the property valued at your expense
there is no contract between you and the valuer
but if the valuer is negligent and you buy the property relying on his report you may still be able to sue him for damages
this is what the house of lords decided in two cases last april in spite of an attempt to get the valuers off the hook by a disclaimer which said i accept that the valuer does not warrant anything stated in his report as being accurate 
alas disclaimers may work if for example the property being valued is industrial or an expensive house
disclaimers may also be usedby referees and others to rob you of a claim for damages
whoever attempts to hide behind a disclaimer must prove it is fair and reasonable to do so
but a disclaimer can never take away your rights under the defective premises act # for the collapsing conservatory or prevent anyone being sued for negligence which has caused death or injury
have we yet reached the point at which we would be awarded damages against the meteorological office because we went camping on the day of an unforecast hurricane
or after we followed the duffadvice of a legal journalist in a newspaper
mercifully we doubt it
book review the cause without a rebel the pale companion andrew motion viking # pounds
by martin pacey
it was unfair of auden to suggest in his letter to lord byron that a poet's sense of other people's very hazy 
but the vaporous presences that float through this slender and anaemic first novel by a notable poet would appear to support the claim
the book which opens a projected sequence of novels that will cover the period from # to the present day aims to explore what the blurb describes as the painful transition from youth to adulthood
this of course is a popular subject it seems particularly attractive to the poet-turned-novelist because of the scope it offers for the tremulously sensitive probing of feelings
sensitivity though is not enough
what andrew motion presents us with here is a static and humourless mood-piece filled with over imagery 
the hero francis mayne is suffering from the adolescent's emotional confusion and acuteself-consciousness
he finds it hard to communicate with people not least his separated parents
his father is a faceless figure a retired brigadier reserved and taciturn
his mother by contrast is the most vividly realised character in the book nervy flirtatious and selfish already on her third husband she thinks primarily of her appearance even when visiting her dying daughter francis's twin
the first half of the novel is dominated by the girl's death from leukaemia
there is a refreshing simplicity and tenderness in motion's account of the way francis nurses her but she herself is too sketchily drawn for the episode to carry much weight 
meanwhile at his public school francis is conducting a love-affair with an older pupil named keith ogilvie
he is finally rejected by the devious arrogant keith who informs him that he is obsolete because he does not know how to make things happen
his response to this rejection is as flat as his reaction to the massive demonstration which keith has earlier persuaded him to join against the vietnam war
this violent event described at length in hysterically colourful terms is the only piece of history to be woven convincingly into the plot 
other broad hints as to the date are inserted with a comical lack of subtlety my god darling have you heard exclaims francis's mother one day as she greets him czechoslovakia
it's been invaded
motion will have to do better than this if he seriously intends his series of novels to capture the feel of a period
but the book's principal defect remains the vacuity of its protagonist
in his eagerness to depict the cloudy psychology of an adolescent motion has forgotten to give the boy a personality
he has however given him a psychotic compulsion to formulate fanciful similes
hardly a page goes by without the hapless francis noticing something which reminds him improbably of something else
sometimes he is reminded of several things 
one moment an avenue of chestnut trees looks a child's drawing of ghosts the next it appears frightening but derelict extinguished chandeliers and finally the chestnuts prance at him holding up their gleaming branches hysterics 
such writing rapidly palls and i hope that in the novels to come motion can curb his reckless passion for it
motoring a lead-free lover's guide to used cars drivers with a tight budget and an environmental conscience can buy second-hand without losing principles says james ruppert
by james ruppert
from this month all new cars submitted for british type approval the test which allows them to be legally sold in the uk must be able to run on lead-free petrol
as a result of this rule and many carefully orchestrated publicity campaigns the motor industry's image has now changed from polluter to pal of the earth
if you can afford an environmentally friendly g-registered runabout then the flora fauna and children of the british isles will have a lot to thank you for
but if you have a tight budget and a conscience running older cars on lead-free fuel becomes a much more complicated issue
without the presence of a lead compound an engine's valve seats go unprotected 
this leads to premature wear and plumes of blue smoke spewing from the exhaust
the only effective remedy is to install hardened valve seats or a replacement cylinder head both expensive options
less costly but not entirely satisfactory is the practice of making every fourth tankful leaded petrol which protects the valveseats but rather defeats the object 
alternatively there are several chemical additives on the market which aim to provide a substitute for lead although the case for these products has yet to be proved
however many cars built within the last few years have hardened valveseats or alloy cylinder heads that need little simply a retune or no modification to use unleaded petrol
finding out which cars can and which cannot is not difficult
esso filling stations have a free booklet listing most models produced since # as does the charity clear #-# # with more detail available in the unleaded petrol guideautodale #
looking at those lists provides interesting reading and bears out the used-car trade's view that having a lead-only car could prove to be a liability
it is not as if four-star leaded fuel is going to be phased out tomorrow but more and more buyers are asking does it take unleaded
what is certain is that the pre-# austin mg range all skodas yugos and quite a few lancias do not which does not help already depressed resale prices
a # lancia y# lead only sells for around # whereas the similar fiat uno # from the same year converted to run on unleaded is worth around # more
a lead-only second-hand car is now worth about # per cent less than an unleaded equivalent
in years to come the percentage difference is likely to be much larger 
even so exotica such as lead-only porsche # and ferraris are unlikely to be part of this trend so no bargains there i'm afraid
more impressive are the japanese manufacturers whose cars dating from the early eighties can run on unleaded without adjustment
find a # toyota corolla or # nissan sunny that has not succumbed to rust and you can buy with confidence
on the home front most fords and vauxhalls from at least the mid-eighties can useunleaded
if the greenness of going unleaded still seems a bit of a grey area it is possible to switch to diesel without a shadow of environmental doubt
diesel always has been lead-free and the only adjustments you need to make are mental ones because diesel-powered cars are no longer slow smelly or noisy
they also return more miles to the gallon than their petrol equivalents although service intervals are shorter 
but after the publicity on unleaded fuel there has been increased interest in used diesel power
but remember that these cars accrue and can withstand significantly higher mileages than petrol cars #-# being the norm
the tradition for diesel cars is far better established on the continent and that is where the best buys come from
perhaps the most successful maker is peugeot with a complete range of cars from the small # around # for a #-mile # car to the legendary # =estate about # for a # example
the germans are also fairly accomplished manufacturers although a five-door # golf with a six-figure mileage will still cost #
prestige comes in the shape of a mercedes with the #d or stuttgart taxi commanding # but returning unfailing reliability
even if lead levels in the atmosphere do not bother you i am sure you will find the fact that unleaded petrol is #p cheaper and that diesel fuel boosts mpg by at least a third most interesting

drink desire in search of a name do the french have the mot juste to describe the desire for a reviving drink
in the first of a monthly series michael jackson hunts in vain
by michael jackson
thank god it's saturday
i know that today is saturday because already i am thirsty for a dry hoppy pint of bitter at the end of the afternoon an aperitif to sharpen my appetite for this evening's indian meal
how did you feel as you came to the end of your working week yesterday afternoon
boy i had a thirst
we say we are thirsty when we mean that we fancy a glass of wine a pint of beer a gin and tonic or a shot of whisky the pleasure of naming our poison at the end of a busy day or tiresome week
that is not thirst
to enjoy it we do not need to be dry just in need of a restorative or relaxant or maybe a focus for a social moment or brief encounter
we call it thirst in lieu of a more accurate description
no not more accurate thirst is not accurate at all as a description for this apparently indescribable condition
it is a desire millions of us know and share yet for which we have no name
this desire that cannot find its name though it would dare speak it if it could is pleasurable
it is enjoyable feeling gently hungry or amorous 
no not amorous randy we have a word for that 
any of these conditions is pleasurable so long as there is a good likelihood of satisfaction in reasonably short order 
let puritans and pessimists damn disapprove or dismiss these appetites that is their loss 
those of us who enjoy them need only a name for each condition so that we may discuss them in expectation and in recollection
come to think of it neither hunger nor randiness hits quite the spot 
peckishness and lust perhaps
or does that sound a firm of country solicitors 
this is to digress
what of this thirst that can be satisfied by an unquenching drink
wine is not quenching but no less in demand for that 
try to quench your thirst with a light fresh white and you will drink enough to put you on your back 
beer is quite rightly britain's favourite friday night drink
it can momentarily blunt a thirst but not altogether cut it
the nearest to being quenching is the white beer of berlin
anything with even a modest smack of hops dries the palate ready for the next one
so of course does alcohol itself
it may for a moment seem to quench but it dehydrates as purportedly healthy abstainers are forever telling me
to quench is more than to refresh although our lying lascivious eyes tell us the two are the same
does any drink look more quenching than one of those italian or french patent aperitifs swirling in a refractive pink or russet oiliness clothing the melting ice a campari dubonnet lillet or too rare in this country a picon
are they quenching 
no refreshing
in strasburg they have been known to lace beer with picon thereby ruining both drinks as queen victoria reputedly did with claret and malt whisky but still the result is not especially quenching 
perhaps a shimmering dry martini cocktail minimum dilution stirred not shaken and served straight up looks even more refreshing though its effect is that of a silver mallet 
in the right place possibly new york but san francisco is better the martini is the ultimate thank god it's friday drink
the requirement for such pleasures is a matter of time and place and it does not have to be friday berlin or strasburg new york or san francisco
not feeling thirsty but fancying a drink has a world of moments
some frenchmen start the day with a coffee and calvados
the people of munich call their version of weissbier breakfast beer and have it with a pair of coddled veal sausages
new orleans favours a mid-morning milk punch or its own variation on the gin fizz
if the moment is before a lunch on the plane it really ought to be a bloody mary
if it is at an elegant dinner table there is a choice between a fino sherry or a manzanilla or champagne
none of these requires anything even approaching a thirst
do we really wash down a good meal with claret
port is immediately suggested by stilton cognac by coffee
i do not fully appreciate the experience of an american late-night movie without a bourbon or a book at bedtime without a single malt
these are not moments of thirst but nor are they causes of drunkenness unless one tries to pack all such experiences into one day
we do not drink because we are thirsty
nor if we are in civilised cast of mind because we wish to become drunk
a friend of mine says that her body tells her without being asked the season of the year
at the end of summer her body stops wanting gin and tonics and suddenly desires whisky
if it were only a matter of alcohol would a body care 
people will nevertheless say that the desire is for nothing more than alcohol
so why not a pill or an injection
because there would be no colour no ritual no time and place no glorious variety
worst of all there would be no aroma taste texture or finish
these are sensuous pleasures at their most enjoyable when we ritualise them but how do we feel when we desire them
we who have so many words in our language have none for this 
but then do the french spanish or italians have a word for it
perhaps they do maybe i have not being paying attention too busy with the eau-de-vie anis or grappa
do the greeks have a word for it
could we borrow beg or invent one
answers in a bottle please
if you are feeling for lack of a better word -thirsty let's meet again next month
same time same place 
it will be my turn to get them in i think

weekend garden page #
in the garden update weekend work
from marc champion in washington
secateurs are likely to be the tool most in demand now
the summer's sprawl begins to be oppressive at this stage in the year and trigger fingers are itching to snip back overgrown mallows clear out the mildewing foliage of golden rod and reduce the overpowering bulk of bullyboy ground cover
keep away from jasmine already thick in flower bud and clematis however untidy
buddleias although messy should not be cut back until spring
dead ragged heads of the climbing hydrangea can be removed cutting where the stem joins the main branch
virginia creeper needs to be clipped back from windows and hauled out of gutters
mulching is a pleasant activity for october
it can be done in spring too but there are usually more pressing jobs then
shrubs such as hydrangea particularly relish rich rations
it is a good time to plant hardy shrubs too
clematis so bristles with brittle green shoots in spring that planting then is an anxiety rather than a pleasure
runner beans and french beans have now given up completely and can be cleared off vegetable plots
globe artichokes are sprouting new leaves and may need protection from frost in cold areas
summer bedding is looking tired and should be removed so that the ground can be cleaned and fed ready for spring bulbs or wallflowers
in the garden planning to beat a leafy retreat at home in the first of a series for novice gardeners anna pavord stresses the value of careful forethought
by anna pavord
plants should come a long way down the list of priorities for the novice gardener
there are many things to think about before even the first tentative daffodil bulb is sunk into the ground
the first and most important question to mull over as you gaze at your patch is what is this garden for
if you start writing down some of the responses to that question you will find you have along the way acquired a ragbag of elements that will have an important bearing on the design
if there are small children in the equation there will need to be a flat soft area where they can fall off swings and climbing frames
if you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowels of an expensive machine you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it
some novice gardeners may not want to do much actual gardening at all but conversely do not want to lookout every day over a scene of threadbare grass and rotting fence
their ideal garden will look good and demand little attention
if you are a dedicated sun-worshipper you need to mark out the part of the garden where the sun lingers longest
it may not be the part nearest the house though this is where sitting out areas always tend to be made
you may even as a novice care so passionately about plants that all you want is the maximum space to grow them in
raised beds built down an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening space
privacy is an important consideration
a first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one i am imagining for this series is no more than #ft x #ft and surrounded on all sides by other houses
privacy is a ticklish business where close neighbours are concerned
to throw up an impenetrable berlin wall between you and them could be tactless
trellis is a useful compromise and you can always pretend it was forced on you by the speed of growth of your climbing rose
aesthetes among the novices will by now be thoroughly irritable and complaining that gardens should have as much to do with the soul as with the necessity or not of a washing line or a barbecue pit
so they should and when the list of necessities is securely written down you can ask the second question how do i want this garden to feel 
this question produces as varied a response as the first
some urban gardeners as short of space inside as they are out want their gardens to be extensions of their homes with a great deal of hard paving good furniture and lighting
the garden for them should feel like an extra sitting room gnat-ridden perhaps damp occasionally but an important overflow of living space
closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some sussex meadow and picture it swagged with honeysuckle and waving with ox-eye daisies and scabious
this is a difficult trick to bring off with suburban trains hurtling by on one side and lorries grinding through their gears on the other
a leafy retreat is an excellent goal for a small town garden but it is best made acknowledging the urban setting using un-wild plants such as bamboo acanthus fig vine alchemilla euphorbia wisteria
while you are working through this process take note of the features in the garden that you would like to keep
on a new estate there may be nothing
in an old garden there may be a fruit tree or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that tidied up could add a dash of venerability to the new garden that will emerge around it
if you do not know what a tree or shrub is exercise clemency and give it a year's grace to demonstrate its worth before you turn it over to the axeman
the mood of the garden will dictate its eventual style
it may be clipped classical random cottage modern high-tech or some intensely personal vision of byzantium that no one has ever imagined before but which exists in your head and wants to get out 
do not let anybody particularly gardening writers tread on your dreams 
all this thinking and doodling will have done nothing physically to change the view outside the window but it is a vital part of the gardening process
before you can make you have to know what it is you are making
property houses that are going going gone fed up with trying to sell more people are auctioning their home instead
andrew bibby reports
by andrew bibby
in the small devon town of south molton julie widlake is waiting with anticipation for friday # october
she and her boyfriend have had their future planned for some time they want to start farming in a nearby village where they also intend to build a bungalow
first they have to sell their present house a two-bedroom cottage in the centre of the town
as is the case almost everywhere else the market in devon is depressed and selling has not been easy
so instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyer they have decided to try selling their house by auction
it comes under the hammer at #pm on the #th at the barnstaple motel
we accept that we might not get very much for it but on the other hand we could get more says julie widlake
we've been waiting to move for a long time and we need the money to build the new house
their south molton cottage guide price #-# is one of more than # lots to be put up for sale at the barnstaple auction by bristol and west property services and one of more than a hundred which the building society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight west country venues over a three-day period
bristol and west claims these auctions will help to bring some action to an otherwise slow market and says it was overwhelmed by the response from people wanting to sell in this way 
auctions certainly speed up the house-buying process 
once the hammer has fallen the successful bidder for a house must exchange contracts immediately and pay a deposit
completion normally takes place four to eight weeks later and there is no opportunity for second thoughts
as the bristol and west explains if a bidder does not sign the contract the auctioneer can sign on their behalf
from the vendor's point of view the house is actually sold once a successful bid is made says graham harrison director of bristol and west property services
many people have suffered from sales falling through and from house-buying chains and some of our vendors feel that now's as good a time as any to sell
from the purchasers' point of view auctions can also be attractive if slightly nerve-racking as you wait for bidding to start for the house of your dreams 
the problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking surveys and arranging mortgage finance without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price
not surprisingly several estate agents report difficulties at the moment in attracting enough serious bidders
with an auction you've got to be certain that at least two buyers are there who can commit themselves and the difficulty is that buyers who can proceed are few and far between said david phillip a director of yorkshire estate agents dacre son and hartley
bristol and west hopes that by arranging collective auctions it will be able to overcome this problem
it is also guaranteeing mortgages at # per cent below the normal interest rate for endowment or pension-linked policies on several of the houses up for sale an interesting and innovative service for would-be bidders mortgage surveys will already have been undertaken for these houses
the building society will be staffing a mortgage desk at each auction and says buyers could arrange finance there and then subject of course to proof of income and status
obviously however bristol and west hopes to hear from interested people in advance if only so it can gauge the likely demand for each property before the auction starts
we're trying to smooth the path for purchasers and streamline the system says graham harrison pointing out that live telephone bidding will also be available for those unable to attend
holiday homes and commercial property have been included among the lots to be auctioned
although collective property auctions take place regularly in london often primarily for investors rather than house-hunters in country areas the more typical auction will be just for one house and as likely as not will take place in a nearby pub or village hall
in fact country auctions are often the nearest many villages get to live theatre 
the locals come for the entertainment and to see who's buying into their village observed one auction-goer
pub landlords are usually only too happy to provide free accommodation
it's very exciting and gets the adrenalin going says david phillip whose firm usually undertakes auctions in the otley area
only certain types of property normally come to auction however
traditionally country cottages and houses which have unusual or unique features or are in need of a lot of renovation may be auctioned if only because valuation is likely to be difficult
sometimes too houses have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirements of trustees or executors auctions provide adequate proof that the property has been sold at the going market value and protect trustees from future claims of negligence
less happily but for the same reason repossessed houses are often auctioned
anyone considering selling by auction needs to be aware that the costs involved will be higher 
advertising costs and any expenses incurred in hiring premises are normally passed on by the estate agents to the vendor whether or not the auction results in a sale
in addition agents may charge slightly more commission than usual for a successful sale
in bristol and west's forthcoming auctions a set fee of # plus vat will be charged to everyone entering property to sell with its usual agent's commission about # per cent plus vat charged on top when sales are made 
we accept that we could lose the money we've paid to go to auction but that's a risk we're prepared to take says julie widlake
the secret of a successful outcome depends partly on setting the right reserve price a task the auctioneer undertakes in conjunction with the seller
normally the reserve is set only days or hours before the auction when the agents will already have a good indication of how much interest has been shown 
too high a reserve price can mean no sale and disappointment all round 
you need to understand what your clients expectations are beforehand says graham harrison of bristol and west
agents and their clients may also have the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offers made prior to the auction
inevitably they do not always get it right
peter crowther managing director of a leeds business centre recently bought two semi-detached stone cottages in bramhope on the outskirts of leeds at an auction in the village pub
his successful bid was for # although he had made a higher prior offer which had been turned down 
on the other hand sometimes the drama of the auction and the competition between bidders can have the opposite effect
another recent auction in leeds saw a run-down stone farmhouse without water or other amenities finally fall under the hammer for #
success is by no means guaranteed at auction says graham harrison
in a tough market you need to get the programme right the price right and have a little bit of luck

design crossed lines over the toytown tram city transport could soon be back on the right track says jonathan glancey
by jonathan glancey
modern trams as most continental europeans know neither shake nor rattle nor do they roll
sleek solidly built gentle on the environment they are often an ideal form of city transport
they also exert a fascination very much of their own as they slither round circuses and brush through old city gates flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on winter nights
single-car articulated or double-decker trams are one of the most reliable and enduring forms of public transport invented
the orange-liveried # series trams in milan for example date from #
eventually they will be replaced but more than # years on they run with the rhythmic reliability of a swiss watch
they are as much a part of milan as la scala or the galleria vittore emmanuele
last month it was announced that britain will get its first new-wave trams in #
destined to run in manchester they will relieve traffic congestion and help to reduce the levels of carbon monoxide in the city centre outlying suburbs and satellite towns of bury altrincham salford oldham and rochdale
in britain with the main exception of blackpool not forgetting the single-deckers of the isle of man and llandudno trams had been largely relegated to the history books
otherwise the best place to see working trams has been the tram museum at crich in derbyshire or else in old british transport commission films and ealing comedies
trams disappeared from most british cities in the #
london's venerable red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the thames embankment for the last time in #
somehow the image of the tall thin mournful double-deck tram with its wooden body slatted wooden seats and growling electric motor has stuck in the british mind 
trams it was believed until surprisingly recently are old-fashioned
they had something to do with fish and chips wrapped in newspaper men in hats national health specs smog and powdered egg
they held up the bright new diesel buses and even worse blocked the progressof private motorists in bulbous austins and lumpen humbers in canyon city thoroughfares
they picked up power from a spider's web of unsightly overhead wires
they were inflexible in operation draughty and mobile reminders of tb epidemics with the enamelled do not spit signs screwed to their bulkheads
but the modern tram could hardly be more different
it plays a key role in keeping city streets on the move and is even the object of the best modern designers' desire
in milan for example the commission to design the new generation of jumbo trams which went into service in # was one that leading italian architects and designers fought over 
after all the jumbo a handsome and imposing articulated unit designed by architect engineer and critic klaus giovanni koenig will be seen on the streets of milan for the next half 
spotlessly clean and popular the jumbo is a long-term advertisement for koenig's design skills
the modern tram is a green machine
assuming the power station at the end of the line burns cleanly the tram is virtually pollution free 
standing at traffic lights a koenig-designed jumbo is save for the chatter inside completely silent
the overhead wires are so slight that you have to look hard to see them
powers of acceleration and braking are remarkable the latter far greater than any car
but sadly there is no indication that the gma consortium which will design operate and maintain the first of the new generation british trams in manchester will share the looks of their milanese counterparts
artists' impressions show a tram that has more in common with the flat-faced characterless light trains of the toy docklands light railway
there is still time for gma gec mowlem amec and greater manchester buses to consider employing an inspired architect or industrial designer
after all mancunians and visitors to the manchester conurbation are going to have to look at these mechanical millipedes for well into the twenty-first century
now that buses are no longer designed to enhance the streets they serve manchester has a chance to make a fresh start with its trams
manchester is not alone 
other british towns croydon and southampton among them are also considering modern tramways
these are all referred to as supertram networks the implication being that the new-generation tram is an altogether more dynamic form of transport than its pre-war predecessors 
what it really means is that the new trams are a hybrid between street car and lightweight suburban train
although they will slip through the city centre serving the essential parts shopping malls leisure centres theme parks amusement arcades and museums the manchester supertrams will also head out of town on a mix of reserved track and existing railway lines
the supertram is in effect a low replacement for british rail's ageing fleet of suburban diesel multiple-unit trains those rasping diesels which change gear to the accompaniment of voluminous clouds of acrid black exhaust fumes and the blessing of train spotters
they will perform some of the same functions but they will not be an exact replacement for traditional trams
and although the supertram concept will spread through major cities during the next decade blackpool will still be alone in its use of traditional double-deckers
the churches built on wool angela lambert enjoys the riches at the heart of east anglia
by angela lambert
until six or seven years ago outsiders associated east anglia with fens flatness and the vanished edwardian nannies of frinton
its old churches green fields and long beaches were cherished by the inhabitants of essex suffolk norfolk and cambridgeshire but not yet on the tourist agenda
today i was told villagers living around the great wool churches of lavenham and long melford have to bar their doors and ignore the knocking of tourists who take them for antique shops and offer to buy their furniture
the tourists are right
east anglia on a sunny weekend is a place of matchless beauty
its villages look too good to be true
lavenham and long melford for example have no telegraph poles to preserve the timeless air that pervades them
yet you only have to read ronald blythe's akenfield to realise that these picturesque half-timbered cottages often painted the characteristic essex pink pale salmon ochre or spring-leaf green are more prosperous now than ever in the real past
many are still elaborately decorated with pargeting an ornate patterned plasterwork practised in this area since the early thirteenth century
most of east anglia's prosperity today is due to city commuters the second-homes market and tourism
the ideal hotel from which to explore is dedham hall set among tall trees in the vale of dedham looking directly across towards dedham church on one side and flatford mill on the other both painted by constable
the hotel lies in five acres of fields and garden and the slingos who own it make the most of their beautiful surroundings by running painting courses for about # a week including breakfast and dinner or # for a long weekend
these are so popular that you will need to book at least a couple of months in advance 
the other great joy of dedham hall is the food
the slingos have their own vegetable garden chickens ducks sheep and cows
everything is home-grown home-made and fresh it tastes like forgotten food
if dedham hall is fully booked and it may well be try the best bed-and-breakfast we have ever found just a few miles away at the old vicarage higham near colchester
it is a rambling tudor house run by john and margaret parker whose breakfast room and drawing room look out over a wonderful walled garden beyond which fields of grazing cows stretch down to the river
another hotel that would make a good starting point for a weekend or longer in east anglia is the black lion at long melford
it changed hands recently and is now run by stephen and janet errington
after dinner there when the moon was full and low and deep orange we walked up the road from the hotel to long melford church
its vast walls of flint and glass and gothic tracery were brilliantly floodlit and the churchyard cat sleek and black as tar greeted us querulously and led us right round the church and through the gravestones at the back glimmering and pale in the moonlight
we were quite alone and the great church the size of a cathedral was unearthly in its floodlit moonlit beauty
long melford is one of the wool churches that commemorate the wealth of east anglia in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
another is at lavenham # minutes' drive up the road
just inside the front porch a handwritten book is prefaced with the words this book has been compiled that something more than their mere names may be known of the lavenham men who gave their lives for their country in the great war
this is followed by # or so names each with a description
the much-thumbed book is deeply moving and sets the tone for a walk round this glorious building which has seen the christenings marriages and burials of the folk of the village for more than # years
east anglia is exceptionally rich in churches and cathedrals
there are several splendid houses near long melford that would make for a gentle afternoon's potter through the rooms and possessions of the rich of a few centuries ago
the loveliest to my mind is melford hall whose charming octagonal jacobean gatehouse is reached along an avenue of clipped yew trees and with its high windows flooding the octagon with light is my fantasy of the ideal study
lavenham is often called the finest medieval village in england
it is an image of the world we have lost its gently sloping streets converging upon the market place
here stand the early sixteenth-century timbered guildhall now a museum to # years of the cloth industry
next to it is the little hall dating from the fourteenth century with its floorboards gleaming with the patina of age low-beamed ceilings and a tiny unruly charming walled garden
precisely next door to this is a restaurant called the great house
here in the cool pretty setting of the dining room that was once stephen spender's you will be served an exquisite three-course lunch for # # for children
the wine list is small but perfectly chosen
the service is impeccable
east anglia has bookshops filled with titles like # things for a boy to do
constable landscapes
gainsborough's house to say nothing of huge grey sweeps of empty beach from which at aldeburgh you can buy goggle-eyed skate direct from the fishing boats as they come out of the water
it has colchester oysters
it has ely cathedral its great green windows casting a translucent light across the lady chapel
with all this small wonder it also has tourists
a prayer for the brick cathedral facing st paul's bankside power station is a masterpiece worth preserving gavin stamp argues
by gavin stamp
from the top of the dome of st paul's cathedral the view is no longer dominated by city church steeples but by an intrusive cacophony of drab characterless sixties boxes
one building stands out in this dispiriting panorama of post-war mediocrity a dark powerful mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that stands right across the thames from wren's dome
this is not an office block nor a church although its sublime form might suggest that its architect was adept at designing cathedrals
it is in fact the now redundant oil-fired electric power station that sits on bankside next to the site of sam wanamaker's new globe theatre
bankside power station should never have been built
its architect had spent the war years with fellow royal academicians planning the orderly and spacious london of the future free of smoke and industry
but when asked in # to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since # he soon forgot such idealism and like any architect was glad to have the job
the project was controversial and the power station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not challenge the visual dominance of st paul's
so the single chimney rose only to #ft some #ft below the height of the cross above the cathedral
the irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak scrubbers been less efficient the smoke would have gone straight up into the air
as it was the smokeless shimmer of vapour was so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief with the leadwork on wren's great dome
bankside power station should not have been built
but as it was built it should not now be demolished
that is because it is a magnificent structure the supreme architectural expression of the heroic monumental phase of power station design and the creation of a great architect
bankside was the work of sir giles gilbert scott om the architect of liverpool's anglican cathedral the rebuilt house of commons and some of the last vital products of the gothic revival
he was a designer of extraordinary versatility being responsible for the standard traditional red telephone kiosk waterloo bridge and several power stations
bankside represents the fullest realisation of his industrial aesthetic
scott's first venture into this unlikely field of design was at battersea where in # he was wheeled in as a famous knighted architect by the london power company to try to make acceptable the coal-fired monster power station to which the residents of chelsea and westminster were taking strong exception
this was a brilliant move 
scott was so successful in styling the building in fine brickwork with jazz-modern fluting as john betjeman called it that when the battersea a station was opened in # it was widely acclaimed as a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century
when in # the architects' journal conducted a survey to find what were considered the best modern buildings in britain battersea was placed second and was the favourite of such unlikely celebrities as sir kenneth clark rebecca west and charles laughton
scott was so pleased with the style he had evolved at battersea a treatmentthat humanised industrial forms without denying their function that he also used it on the guinness factory at park royal west london
at battersea scott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the upturned table created by the four corner chimneys
at bankside however he was able to persuade the engineers mott hay & anderson to gather all the flues into a single slender tower or campanile
as a result he was able to create a symmetrical monumental composition of great power 
as at all his power stations scott faced the building in a fine worcestershire brick that has weathered to a lovely pinky-brown
but there is nothing homely about the general effect
vast overlapping planes of brickwork are modelled with careful set-backs and subtle bands of detail
the result is an expression of the monumental aesthetic of the early twentieth century with strong american overtones
when the campanile is seen from a distance it seems to belong to some strange expressionist church one has not noticed before
not for nothing were such power stations described as brick cathedrals bankside is the finest manifestation of this tradition
now it is redundant
smoke shimmers no longer from the tall tower
but bankside is nevertheless a sound structure which like the best mills of the industrial revolution is well worth preserving and is perfectly capable of adaptation for a new commercial use
such re-use is of course much encouraged by a building being listed something which until recently was not possible with architecture of so recent a date
two years ago however the department of the environment at last began the listing of post-war buildings in england that were more than # years old
bracken house the former home of the financial times became the first candidate and english heritage then submitted some # recommendations to the department of the environment these included bankside
this however was too much for the government and using the excuse that public opinion was not yet ready to accept the protection of many unpopular modern buildings lord caithness the minister of state for the environment arbitrarily whittled down english heritage's list to # buildings excluding bankside although it represented a more traditional approach in the fifties to the now-unfashionable modern movement 
however caithness himself stated that this first selection was in no way a definitive list
i have no doubt that others will be added
the important thing is that the thirty year rule is in force and that we can respond to developing perceptions of our times
earlier this year in my capacity as chairman of the thirties society i asked caithness's successor virginia bottomley to reconsider english heritage's recommendation of bankside for listing
my argument was that as michael heseltine had so boldly listed battersea power station in # it was illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect
furthermore the listing of battersea had ensured the building's survival for conversion to a new use in that case as an entertainment centre which the prime minister herself had praised and inaugurated
after two months' silence i was informed that ministers stood by their decision
i wrote back asking the reasons for this pointing out that if any large modern power station deserved to be listed it was bankside
i have received no satisfactory reply
of course i know perfectly well why the department of the environment declines to list it
listed building procedures might impede the full commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatised
furthermore british rail has its eyes on the bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for channel traffic which it is so absurdly driving under the middle of london at astronomical cost
listing in theory is an objective assessment of architectural or historical importance which does not necessarily prevent demolition
in the case of bankside power station the ultimate temple of power and a masterpiece of industrial architecture by a major twentieth-century british architect our historic building system is being perverted for purely political reasons
musicals bows of holly mark steyn reviews london's latest musical biography buddy at the victoria palace
by mark steyn
the texans drawl y'all blacks go yo hispanics leer hey ameeeeeeeego
and towering above these stage cliches is of course the driven genius whose music cannot be stemmed by the forces of reaction 
who is it this time
wagner glenn miller jason donovan
no matter only the accents change and the pants here the squares wear slacks the good guys blue-jeans
warned not to sing rock'n'roll on a c&w station buddy holly insists i gotta play ma music
misunderstood by decca records he maintains i wanna play ma music ma way 
even when the hits start he's not content
we gotta take our music more serious he tells the crickets who remain unconvinced
you got money you got fame he pleads what you want to booze for
booze
we're midway through act ii and a solitary six-pack has yet to hove into view
but this is a plot development the plot development and if it involves turning a couple of aled jones into oliver reed why let logic get in the way 
as it happens there is a kind of logic behind buddy
the most common reason for a biomusical is opportunism take a star like judy garland or john lennon and you pick up a hit title and a hit score ready-made
now alan janes's play matches the well-loved songs with equally well-loved dialogue in a k-tel golden greats collection of dramatists' reliables
choke up at the price of fame i give em everything and they stick a knife in my back 
fight back those tears at the inevitable parting you and me boy i reckon we've come to the end of our road 
marvel at the little woman behind the man i'd like to sing a song fer a special girlfriend who's kinda important to me
the justification for this is authenticity
all that happens in the play is based on fact janes pledges solemnly in the programme notes
as we know truth is often stranger than fiction
often
most of us prefer to watch dallas than our neighbours' home-movies because when it comes down to it we know that truth is generally a lot duller than fiction
occasionally though a dramatist will uncover someone with an interesting story regardless of how unknown or vaguely remembered the subject is
how many of us can now recall the real maria von trapp or fanny brice
they live only through the sound of music and funny girl
buddy holly comes somewhere between the subjects of those and more parasitic biographies
his records are still played but his personality unexposed through movies or extensive tv interviews is almost entirely unknown
it is in theory the best of both worlds except that buddy holly by all accounts was not terribly interesting
he was born in lubbock married a nice spanish girl and died young in a plane crash in #
all that counts are the records a rhythmically unusual tex-mex fusion of rock'n'roll and older western elements pioneering what became the standard pop instrumentation of two guitars bass and drums
the lyrics are another matter
of the two prototype rock songwriters it's the more worldly chuck berry you turn to for the authentic picture of teenage pleasures in eisenhower's america gonna write a little letter gonna mail it to my local deejay
or cruising and playing the radio with no particular place to go
berry's songs are plausible emblems of rock'n'roll rebellion or at any rate youthful hedonism
buddy invites us to regard holly in the same light mocking in a horribly nudging re-creation lubbock old-timers like the hayriders who sing when the sun goes down on blue ridge mountain it's the time to whistle in your ear
at least this has a surreal daftness
the voice of rock'n'roll in contrast is almost unrelievedly soupy 
if you didn't know the tunes you'd assume holly's lyrics decorated some innocent backporch spooners from the turn stars appear and the shadows are fallin' you can hear my honey callin'
or you give me all your lovin' and your turtle-dovin' 
or when cupid shot his dart he shot it at your heart 
not only are these songs impossible to use dramatically they're also too vague to use as incidental music to underline or punctuate aspects of holly's life or the # more generally
i wrote it for you he assures his gal before the ballads but how can you tell
all you can do with these songs is sing them and buddy fails even to manage that with any subtlety
the finales to both acts are effectively concerts the sort of agreeably naff rock'n'roll revival that might just about pass muster as a capital gold one-nighter down the hammersmith palais
and for all the appeal of his singing and playing paul hipp comes out pretty dull between the numbers
to camouflage the failures of the play andy walmsley has created a set which resembles a pile-up of roadside hoardings oldsmobile van heusen shirts texaco premium type
rob bettinson the director has deduced that he ought to have these images plus disc-jockeys radio commercials midwestern hops but he doesn't seem to know why
like most shows which are manufactured with an eye to commercial success winnie high society to name only buddy's predecessors at the victoria palace this one will probably fail 
it's not as if there aren't aspects of his career that aren't worth exploring how did he come to use drums then almost unknown in texan country line-ups
was it true as the chart performance of heartbeat his last release suggests that his three-year career was already on the wane 
and surely any dramatist ought to be able to move us with that final night of holly's life when his musicians including waylon jennings gave their places on the plane to the big bopper and ritchie valens
the author's job is not merely to offer an illustrated who's who entry but to turn elements of a man's life into a dramatic entity
and if holly's too boring for that perhaps the best approach would be to write about his impact on others
that after all is what don mclean did so brilliantly in american pie a personal reaction to the day the music died

the # have witnessed a shift in the art establishment's attitudes towards art produced outside of its traditional parameters
the work of previously marginalised artists has become an area of rich speculation among art dealers priced out of the modern masters market 
almost every year has witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain graffiti art soviet art australian art the art of latin america
the major auction houseshave moved with the times and have found new ways of selling works which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago
the current status of the work of the mexican painter frida kahlo is a dramatic example of this change
once known primarily as the wife of diego rivera her reputation outside of mexico now far supercedes his since # sale room estimates of her work have risen from # to over # million and in # a work by kahlo broke all records at sotheby's new york for a latin american artist
the enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content 
while the first wave of popular interest arose with the # whitechapel exhibition instigated by laura mulvey and peter wollen it was the publication of hayden herrera's biography of kahlo in # which has led to her current cult status
since that date she has been the subject of tv documentaries a feature film frida by paul leduc a stage play numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing
in may # magazine ran a # page feature on frida kahlo as the spirit of mexico fig # while in feb # there was a # page interpretation of the romance of frida kahlo's mexico fig #
almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz it emerged in the summer of # that madonna already a devotee of kahlo's work was commissioning a screenplay based on kahlo's life 
 may # p #�#
as with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of kahlo's admittedly fascinating life
the passionate obsession with her husband diego rivera her flamboyant appearance but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work
while kahlo's art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art
in this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of van gogh a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable bythe media attention generated during the centennial of his death
the archetypal dropout spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of #'s long hot summer
yet despite the iconic status of van gogh's tragic life it is the appearance of his work bywhich he is ultimately signified his thick impasto brush-stroke his vibrant yellows the urgency of his creative drive 
in the case of kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself the characteristic brows the elaborate hair the mexican costume fig #
it is primarily her appearance not the formal language of her art that has graced the pages of and magazines
the feature transposed the kahlo style to kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of herrera's biography of the artist
in the later piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their mexican interiors
there is a poignant irony in the way clothing which on one level served to hide kahlo's broken body falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique fig #
the visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist as from her work
in both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about mexico itself exotic passionate yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit
while and subsequently fig # stressed different facets of kahlo's public persona they all shared the emphasis on her an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of mexico rather than her work
it is her body the canvas her appearance art 
the art of self-expression becomes self-expression as art
 february # p #�#
 may # p #
of course the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in kahlo's case
the majority of her work is self portraiture her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance
dressing up role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of kahlo's work
in # fig # she paints herself wearing rivera's suit challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority while simultaneously threatening castration
more disturbingly in # fig # she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portraits as revealing of her inner emotions
where does the mask fall does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features mask far more than it uncovers 
there is however an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image a process which the artist was mocking as early as # some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress a la mexicana but the poor souls only look cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible'
the impossibility stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of kahlo's choice of clothing a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances
the particularities of post-revolutionary mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avant-garde
for kahlo however choosing to don the costume of the tehuana as for example in # fig # was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity
mexican indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific varying from region to region
the tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest to pre-hispanic forms of clothing
it is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed kahlo's choice
the ostensibly matriarchal society of tehuantepec led to the adoption of the tehuana in post-revolutionary mexico as the image of the strong indian woman the undefeated counterpart to the despised chingada who conversely is the female embodiment of mexico's hybrid post-conquest culture
in a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently usedto convey racial and political conflict the tehuana represents that aspect of mexico's indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule 
kahlo's adoption of tehuana dress while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position 
 february # p #
 #th april # p #
in kahlo's work there is a powerful mix of these discourses yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work
it is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the # that her current reputation has evolved 
her work almost perfectly illustrates debates as to the nature of traditional exclusions of a woman's art
the fascination with functions of the body the analogies between artistic and physical creative processes self-portraiture usedto reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the #

in their formal language kahlo's works are exemplary of certain feminist arguments the adoption of the decorative the intimate and non-fine art mediums reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definitions of high art
this appropriateness of kahlo's aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context to stress the collective and the cross-cultural
although this is not in itself to be dismissed as a tactic it has diminished the complexity of kahlo's achievement as a specifically mexican painter operating within the particularities of her historical moment
more problematic is the way in which such a dislocation has led to the acceptance of her mexicanness as mere decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by breton a ribbon round a bomb 
it is the ribbon that runs through the pages of the glossy surface of the images in direct opposition to a work such as kahlo's # fig #
in this painting a memorial to a woman's tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her
hale's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social values of new york and north america in general
the story behind hale's death was one with which kahlo obviously identified and within which dress formed an important symbolic function
before jumping from the window of her apartment hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer
in kahlo's painting the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street literally coming down to earth
hale's eyes stare knowingly at the viewer a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture 
the horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building
she leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world 
although destroyed she has also escaped
the painting dedicated to hale's mother was commissioned by a mutual friend of kahlo and dorothy hale the managing editor of clare boothe luce
the painting was agreed to by luce in part to recompense for what she saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend
having lent hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sums on an haute-couture dress and refused to turn up what in retrospect became hale's farewell party
later it was revealed that the money had come from a different source 
a male friend had tried to dissuade hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy the most beautiful dress in new york telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband
on one level this work deals with a generalised woman's experience yet the metaphorical power of dorothy hale's dress derives from kahlo's useof clothing in her own self-portraits
dress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in the wearer its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses 
hale's black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values of the gringolandia so hated by kahlo
in those paintings where kahlo wears european dress she is passive weak and unable to control her own destiny but in the tehuana costume she is strong powerful hopeful
unclothed her body becomes yet more vulnerable but as jean franco states
the unclothed body is not a self but a socialised body a body that is opened by instruments technologized wounded its organs displayed to the outside world 
the inner frida is controlled bymodern society far more than the clothed frida who often marks her deviation from the norm bydefiantly returning the gaze of the viewer
kahlo's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of mexico's colonised past la llorona the weeping woman of popular myth and la chingada the raped and abused mother described in paz's 
descended from an aztec mother goddess llorona is a long-suffering mother figure symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the spanish invasion
driven mad with grief bythe loss of her child she is thought to wander the streets weeping and crying out a ghostly memory of the pre-conquest past
at its most simple la chingada as the mother of mestizo culture is the mother forcibly opened violated or deceived
the female soil possessed and misused bythe masculine force of the spanish invaders
the indian mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child 
the rhetoric of the tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisations of colonial trauma and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance

a major though often ignored work by kahlo demonstrates the cultural politics underlying her art
# fig # is one of the artist s most formally adventurous works mixing photographic collage with paint to produce a critique of north american culture 
kahlo does not appear in the work her tehuana costume hangs empty in the centre of the composition suspended between a toilet bowl and a golfing trophy
on one level is a coda to # fig # of the previous year
this small painting on metal in the style of a catholic votive image shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist north america and the archaic fertility of mexico
interwoven with these images are subtler references to the borderlines which separate latin american culture from that of europe and north america
this is doneby a series of juxtapositions the past versus the present female nature versus masculine technology growth versus exploitation and in its very material presence the traditions of fine art versus the popular
at the same time the ambivalence of her own and modern mexico's position is manifested in the figure of the artist
the paper flag of her homeland is contrasted to the modernity of the cigarette held in her other hand
the red and green of the aztec necklace links it compositionally with the indigenous plants to the south of the painting the pink colonial-style dress tonally blending with the skyscrapers to the north 
 again suggests a conflict but the ambivalence is gone 
nature has been banished technology and its concomitant values reign over a harshly masculine world
three elements refer to the female presence all of them dealing with an essential lack
the empty dress a peeling poster of mae west and in the far distance the statue of liberty
frida kahlo # #x# cm estate of dr
leo eloesser
although occasionally humorous the work presents a bleak view of urban alienation
the church wall street and industry are joined by a network of telephone lines forming a remorsely inhuman environment
beneath this man-made mechanism of oppression are the people literally distanced from their surroundings bykahlo's useof photo-collage
in the forefront of this scene flutters the dress incongruously vibrant despite its suggestion of loss 
dislocated from its political context it hangs a above the teeming streets of the city decorative yet potentially explosive 
there is no place there for the values the tehuana dress represents its folds are given meaning bykahlo's search for a cultural identity
within the confines of the painting it becomes a silent emblem of protest a reminder of political alternatives
the physicality so characteristic of kahlo's work is missing no flesh no blood just the tawdriness of the peeling poster and the hollow reminder of lost liberty
the inter-relationship of body and dress so self-consciously referred to in many of kahlo's most polemical works fig # has been strangely inverted byher current popularity
her mexicanness has become a stylistic gloss decorative colourful pretty even individualistic 
the colonised body which kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism has lost its function as a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering
what is obscured by this process is that it was through clothing in both art and life that kahlo attempted to redress the wrongs of history

jackboots beneath the serge television
by hugh hebert
there was one point when the hair on the back of my head began to lift
not at paul hill's remembrance of beatings past when he could hear the sound of steel-tipped boots running to take part in the fun and once heard a principal medical officer no less telling colleagues don't walk his face don't walk his face
not even the time he was dunked head first in a tub of dubious liquid and brought up gasping for breath make him sing god save the queen they shouted
brutality as hill describes and felt it was a bitter part of his prison life you just learnt to get down on the floor as fast as you could and cover up as best you could
but it was gerry conlon's account of being interrogated after the guildford bombings that made the scalp crawl 
we know your mother works at the royal victoria hospital they told him we know where your sister works and there are sectarian killings down there
they told me they could arrange an accident
and i believed they were capable of murdering my mother i honestly believe they would have murdered my mother that's why i signed the statement
the account he gave just after his release was that the threat had been that a british soldier might accidentally shoot one of the women
a few months ago even this would have seemed improbable
you might have assumed this was the police bluffing and bullying 
yet given what we have learned about links between the security services and the loyalist paramilitaries in northern ireland and the deep suspicion about surrogate murders you can't shrug off the shiver conlon's words bring 
there were daunting moments in last night's first tuesday yorkshire but few of them matched that hint of a jackboot under the blue serge 
it's right that the guildford four have told their stories now to grant mckee and ros franey and first tuesday the programme and the producers who dug away and did much to keep the case alive 
and they told it without on-screen questioning though the programme is skilfully structured to give it a coherence it might have lacked
carole richardson's is the most haunting face
you have to hope that its blankness will slowly dissolve and let life in 
just once a couple of tears rolled down
it was when she described seeing film of the results of the bombing on television and thinking they think i did that 
armstrong seems the least permanently damaged on the surface 
he pays tribute to his treatmentat gartree prison he apologises to the bomb victims' families that they have had to keep reminding them of their loss but we had to fight for our freedom
hill expresses the way time has cheated them his daughter was born while he was remanded in custody and is now # she would change dramatically and i didn't feel a change in myself mentally
i'm still # in my head
nothing's happened to me
i haven't lived
but again it was conlon the slightly wild-eyed irish poet of the quartet articulate flamboyant remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the old bailey who cut deep into the collective conscience 
he described being taken over the years to see his sick and finally dying and almost certainly innocent father in another prison
he was convicted with the maguires in the parallel case of a bomb factory
and he tells how none of the assembled guards and officials could look his father in the eye as he protested his innocence
only the nurses could do that 
and at the end conlon drew the one hopeful conclusion if this stops capital punishment ever coming back the time i've spent in prison will be well worth it
if this stops another innocent person going to prison it'll be well worth it
i've had numerous prison governors say to me yes conlon we know you're innocent but there's nothing we can do about it
we get a custody order and that's it
what sort of system of justice is that 
it wasn't the only programme last night to shine light into dirty corners 
inside the brotherhood granada produced by claudia milne and martin short dug into the most notorious area of masonic influence local government
in southend where # of the # adult males are reckoned to be masons it went into the case of what you might call preferential allocation of council property and the battle of one councillor christopher hudson to break the grip of the men on the square we can't have a secret society operating within the framework of a democracy he said
it's a paradox it's a nonsense
though over the years from southend to tyneside and the government's own property services agency there's all too much evidence that this is exactly what we do have 
the us sets its compass on two trading oceans notebook
by edited by alex brummer
canberra may seem an awful long way from exchanges on the floor of the house of commons over the european monetary system 
but were it not for the perceived economic might of a more unified economic community the dozen or so nations of the pacific rim who have been meeting in australia might not have bothered 
the first albeit tenative steps towards forming a new pacific-based economic union display an astute awareness of the way events are moving within europe movements with which number # has yet to come to grips 
not so long ago it seemed as if the world was to divide into three main trading blocks the ec based around the west german economy a northern american block based around the us-canadian free trade area and a pacific unit incorporating the asian tigers with japan and the yen at the centre 
but the metternich-like skills of the us secretary of state mr james baker are ensuring that america maintains a strong stake in each forum 
it firstly boldly asked for a seat at the top table at the european community a suggestion rudely rebuffed
the us has talked of a genuine north american free trade zone incorporating the us canada and mexico which would have the best of all worlds with high skills and a cheap labour force south of the rio grande
now it is making a third bid for influence
it has turned up in canberra with japan to develop asia pacific economic co-operation apec and a new #-nation organisation which will mimic the role of the organisation for economic co-operation and development in europe
preliminary steps taken to conduct studies on trade technology and investment flows in the region may seem insignificant
but mr baker plainly views it as otherwise
he noted that the canberra meeting is the start of something which could grow into a very significant development not only for the region but for the global economy
if the more economically puny asean countries indonesia malaysia singapore brunei thailand and the philippines were to bury their reservations then the high growth from other partners including such tigers as thailand and south korea alongside the more mature economies of japan and australia could mean a dynamic coalition
it would then be up to the us and canada to decide whether they want to face towards the atlantic or pacific or be caught between two great trading oceans
heading for default
the question of just who would even want to be a partner with the us was underlined last night as the american administration headed for default for the first time in its history
congress was frantically trying to complete a bill raising the federal debt ceiling in time for president bush to sign today
leaders on capitol hill virtually put all other business on hold as it sought to hammer out a debt ceiling increase 
the treasury secretary nicholas brady a levelheaded figure warned that the imbroglio may lead to higher interest costs for the taxpayer
what should have been a routine exercise in extending the government's borrowing power to # thousand billion became bogged down in wrangling over legislative initiatives lawmakers wanted to attach to the bill
as a result of the stalemate the treasury has been forced to postpone #billion in debt auctions this week
lack of congressional action also forced the treasury to suspend new sales of us savings bonds and of special securities for state and local governments
this market sensitive dispute has taken place as president bush and congress continued to spar on a primary cause for government borrowing the budget deficit
at a press conference to mark his election victory a year ago mr bush threatened to veto the budget unless it contained real cuts 
otherwise congress would have to face the consequences of automatic across-the-board cuts under the gramm-rudman-hollings budget deficit reduction law
america may have changed presidents a year ago but the fiscal thicket remains as inpenetrable as ever
political expediency
no longer can the government disguise the crisis surrounding electricity privatisation
ministers have already had to pull britain's fleet of magnox reactors out of the float and delay the sell-off date by up to six months
but it has now become clear that further drastic amendments are needed to flotation plans 
after months of turning deaf ears to warnings by the city and industry the department of energy has at last conceded that nuclear plant cannot be included in the share float without state support 
this leaves the energy secretary mr john wakeham with two options he can either agree to underwrite any cost escalations in nuclear handling costs after privatisation or he can swallow his pride and pull all nuclear plant out of the impending sale
whatever the outcome the government's willingness to continue pushing through the float during this parliament shows how ministers are prepared to put political expediency before the interests of the industry
for the nuclear element in electricity privatisation is the coping stone on which the flotation plans are based 
national power was given # per cent of the cegb's generating capacity in order to give it an economic mix of power 
the other # per cent is to be operated by powergen the other cegb successor company
take away or subsidise all nuclear power stations and you lose the commercial logic of the privatisation plans 
electricity privatisation needs to go back to the drawing board 
at the very least the cegb should be divided into a wider range of generating companies to stimulate competition
is it worth sacrificing the long-term future of britain's biggest stateowned industry to make political capital in the run-up to the next election
#comment the guardianwednesday november # # more than just another disaster
thirty five people died and others were maimed for life in the clapham rail disaster in december last year because work was done in a slovenly haphazard way and was then left unchecked
the disaster was all the more stunning because people had come to assume that such things didn't happen
in most years rail deaths are few in some there are none at all
clapham indeed accounts for nearly half the # fatalities of the last ten years compare that with the # deaths and # injuries every year on the roads
yet yesterday's report on the clapham crash confirming the picture which emerged throughout the hidden inquiry makes an event which seemed at the time totally unexpected look almost inevitable
this was a system hopelessly under strain 
under strain for a start because it was technically ill-equipped to avert disaster or to cope with the consequences when disaster struck under strain from commercial pressures which as the inquiry puts it compromised safety under strain above all because the people on the spot couldn't or wouldn't cope were weary from gruesome working hours the senior signal technician who heads the list of the culpable had had only one day off in the past # weeks lacked adequate training or simply couldn't be bothered
the bulk of the blame for all that is placed on british rail which knowingly permitted these things to continue
though individuals are nailed the greatest villain of all is the system 
in a desperately competitive climate where anyone bright and competent could go down the road and pick up a better paid job with kinder hours and more congenial working conditions from someone like british telecom the railways ran a service dependent on people who belonged to a narrow and inbred working culture with outdated procedures of training and promotion and an institutional reliance on overtime working whose wholly disgraceful dimensions are symbolised by the fact that maximum weekly hours were only recently cut to # hours a week
the transport secretary mr cecil parkinson assured the commons yesterday that financial considerations would not stand in the way of implementing sir anthony hidden's # recommendations
on the technical side remedial work is in many cases already on the way 
but the job of lifting the standards of people employed giving them proper training and paying a wage which breaks dependence on overtime and lifts morale this together must far exceed the costs of the technology and it isn't by any means clear what the bill will be or where the money will come from 
all of which is not just a problem for a properly penitent british rail it's a problem for government too
government fixes the format in which br has to work and if as the hidden report attests many of its problems today reflect lack of past planning lack of farsighted investment living from hand to mouth then that is not just br's doing 
government compounds all these problems when it sets down working parameters which fail to reflect the value the country gets from a system that is run efficiently can shift people to destinations with exemplary speed and safety as europe consistently demonstrates 
it is sad and somewhat ominous that so little of that should have been reflected in the sombre statement which mr parkinson made in the house yesterday
a service in chaos
the nation's ambulance service was in manifest chaos yesterday
there was no service in london with all # stations and # vehicles off the road 
the only accident and emergency relief was provided by the police part-time st john ambulance volunteers running # vehicles and the red cross
outside the capital accident and emergency services were being provided in most areas but the ban on emergency work was tightened 
the service was facing its biggest crisis since the ambulances came to a stop in the winter of discontent ten years ago
like labour in # the conservatives have put military ambulances on standby
they move in today
what has gone wrong
there are three key causes of the shambles mr kenneth clarke the failure to separate emergency from non-emergency work and the whitley council negotiating machinery 
the health secretary accused the unions of posturing and pretending to run a # service yesterday
he was right
by refusing to keep open two-way radio links the crews had effectively ended a proper emergency service
the move was signalled last week and true to their promised response management suspended the workers involved in the disruption
but posturing and pretending went far beyond the unions
mr clarke has been indulging in just that himself putting up the luckless duncan nichol chief executive of the health service to take the initial flak under the pretence that the dispute is not his direct responsibility
yet it was mr clarke not mr nichol who was involved in the critical decisions the cash limit for the nhs the # per cent offer to ambulance workers compared to seven per cent for nurses eight per cent for doctors and nine per cent for ancillary workers and today's introduction of military ambulances
ambulance workers on emergency work do deserve a much higher increase
they have progressed far beyond routine first aid
their paramedical skills cover highly technical procedures intubation infusion and defebrillation
the crews are able to resuscitate heart attack patients replace fluid intraveneously after severe blood loss and insert tubes to maintain air supplies in unconconscious casualties
yet the ambulance worker is only being offered # when a fire officer is being given # and a metropolitan police constable can earn #
but only two million out of the # million journeys which ambulance crews carry out each year are emergency calls
nine out of # are routine calls many of which could be carried out by mini cabs
mr duncan nichol wants to separate the emergency from the non-emergency work
he is right to pursue this line 
wiltshire and northumbria have already shown how much can be achieved
the ramshackle whitley council negotiating machinery is the other reason why the ambulance workers have lost out
until this year the three independent review bodies which make recommendations for nurses doctors and the professions allied to medicine have given much higher awards than the whitley councils
as lord mccarthy noted some # years ago the management side of the councils comprise employers who do not pay and paymasters who do not employ
a much more flexible system which would allow local managers to negotiate local rates on a national pay spine is needed
a crisis an agenda for reform and honesty
one mr clarke cannot duck away from if he wants to avoid a second winter of discontent
opening closing 
prince charles is jolly good at opening things 
he needs to be for the next four days in hong kong because he will be hard at work cutting ribbons and laying foundation stones
the hong kong university of science and technology the hong kong island divisional headquarters of the red cross the new cultural centre and many more
he is even re-opening the already opened eastern harbour tunnel and subway crossing
it is all standard royal stuff but not much help to the millions who fear that hong kong will not remain open after #
the whole point of a visit to hong kong now five months after tiananmen square should be to declare with royal authority that britain shares the concerns of the hong kong people and is determined to do something about them
there was already a rather perfunctory air to the queen's visit three years ago as if it were just a required coda to her tour of china
when the prince and princess of wales quite rightly scrapped their tour of the mainland they had the opportunity to make a contrasting point in hong kong
unless they can say something relevant in the next four days the many hong kong critics who believe the visit is a waste of dollars will be absolutely right
it did not help at all that upon arrival yesterday the royal couple instantly touched base in that comforting symbol of past british power the hong kong and shanghai bank
if there is a failure of imagination to use the royal visit creatively it will also be a failure of nerve
britain still cannot decide when to play the mandarinate game of silence with the chinese and when to break the rules as beijing does all the time
the ideal tactics should be a mixture of both but only if a clear message can be communicated to the hong kong people that someone is standing up for them somewhere
instead the latest developments in sino-british relations have left them even more confused than before 
china claims that the hong kong government recently gave a written commitment to limit the activities of the pro-democracy movement in the territory
the government denies this but has published the text of a letter fromits political adviser to the new china news agency beijing's embassy in hong kong suggesting that it did
in a tone of meek appeasement the letter draws attention to the arrest by hong kong police of anti-china demonstrators outside the agency's national day reception
it also reminds beijing that permission has been refused for local protesters to erect a replica statue of democracy on a permanent site
it ends by assuring beijing that the hong kong government will have a prudent regard for the special circumstances of hong kong and the interests and concerns of the chinese government
meanwhile the flood of letters of a very different sort from anxious hong kong citizens to this and every other newspaper office continues
so do the chinese press statements asserting that hong kong is entirely a business between china and britain and should not be discussed formally or informally at any international forum 
the only two hong kong legislators who consistently dare to speak out mr martin lee and mr szeto wah have been threatened with expulsion from the committee now drafting china's post-# basic law
our latest foreign secretary has yet to publicly pick up the file marked hong kong
there is still endless dithering on how broad a safety net britain will extend to its citizens
they may rightly feel that it is all really rather appalling

parliament urged to think again on housing issue
queen's bench divisional court sandwell metropolitan borough council v bujok before lord justice watkins and mr justice hutchison november # #
if a dwelling house is in such a state of disrepair as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance the tenant may lay an information against his landlord alleging the existence of a statutory nuisance under the public health act #
the tenant is not obliged to ensure that the landlord is aware of the defects in the premises or to give the landlord an opportunity to remedy the defects before commencing legal proceedings
although that is the position in law the court emphasised that as a matter of commonsense a tenant should first complain to the landlord before exercising the right to prosecute
the facts
mrs bujok and her family occupied a house as council tenants
in september # mrs bujok laid an information against the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance under section # of the public health act #
it was alleged that the council being the owners of the premises were the persons by whose act default or sufferance the nuisance arose 
prior to laying the information mrs bujok had not served an abatement notice upon the council or informed them of the alleged defects in the premises
the justices held mrs bujok was not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective stateof the property prior to laying the information
the council appealed by case stated
the legislation
section # of the # act defines statutory nuisances as any premises in such a stateas to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance
the decision
mr justice hutchison said the # act primarily envisages a system where the local authority has a power and a duty to try to secure that premises are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance
action is initiated by the service of an abatement notice requiring remedial work
if the person in default fails to comply with an abatement notice the localauthority is obliged to make a complaint to the magistrates
if the complaint is proved a nuisance order is made requiring the defendant to get the necessary work done
effectively the sequence is that the person in default is told what is wrong and is required to put it right
he is given an opportunity to do so and if he does not he is subject to sanctions by the court to compel him to do so
the problem arises in connection with section # which adapts or applies the provisions to cases where an individual rather than the local authority wishes to make the complaint
need he serve an abatement notice
the authorities plainly establish that he need not and cannot do so
does that mean he may lay an information and bring the matter before the magistrates without first putting the person alleged to be in default on notice of what is alleged
the council argued that a landlord particularly one such as a local authority cannot realistically be expected to have a system of inspection of all its premises and in practice is entitled to depend upon notification by its tenants
for mrs bujok it was argued that the # act was designed to secure in the interests of the community at large that statutory nuisances did not exist
it was submitted that an owner cannot turn his back on his property because when he purchases and takes on the responsibility of letting he knows the property will in the course of time deteriorate
he must therefore satisfy himself on a regular basis that it does not constitute a statutory nuisance
in warner v lambeth london borough council # # hlr # # lord justice glidewell said a private person could lay an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance without first giving notice requiring abatement
therefore in the present case the justices came to the correct conclusion
his lordship reached that decision without enthusiasm because it seemed that as a matter of common sense notice should be given in such circumstances before criminal proceedings were launched 
lord justice watkins said he agreedwith reluctance
it was surely repugnant to commonsense that in this area of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of its tenants without first being given the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequences of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupied
in law there was no doubt that mrs bujok was entitled to commence proceedings without giving notice of the state of the dwelling to the council
but in every other conceivable way that action was entirely wrong
endless trouble to many people in courts and council offices and much money could be saved by the giving of notice of disrepair
if the council did not react to that notice then would be the time for the tenant to exercise the right to prosecute
parliament should give fresh thought to enacting a provision placing an obligation upon a council tenant to give notice to the council before being permitted to commence proceedings

leinster face an uphill task
by robert armstrong in dublin
the all blacks begin the irish leg of their #-match tour at lansdowne road today against leinster who have never beaten a major touring side 
leinster have named a team that looks strong on paper including eight internationals yet they recently lost to both munster and ulster in the inter-provincial championship
such is the mood of pessimism here it is hard to find anyone who believes the all blacks having won their seven matches in wales will face any significant threat during the next fortnight
ulster the provincial champions may well fancy their chances on november # but leinster look certain to face an uphill struggle even though the tourists have rested # of the team that beat wales
leinster will be hard pushed to keep the score within the respectable margins of defeat set by their predecessors 
in # the all blacks defeated leinster #-# they won #-# in # and scraped home #-# in #
however during the eighties irish provincial rugby has assumed a third world status in relation to new zealand's
leinster have been undermined by their failure to secure prestige fixtures since the mid-seventies
when new zealand last toured ireland in # leinster were ignored 
the same thing happened in # when the province was denied a fixture against the wallabies
such neglect has done nothing for their confidence
even so the all blacks who include seven capped players will give today's opponents due respect
as their coach alex wyllie remarked when we arrived in wales we were told cardiff were no damned good and look how well they played against us
leinster are quite capable of doing the same
wyllie is confident his western samoan wing va'aiga tuigamala will play although he is still niggled by an ankle injury received against neath two weeks ago
the test flanker alan whetton whose hamstring injury kept him out against wales will form a powerful back row with kevin schuler and the international no# zinzan brooke
the tourists will field four backs aged # or under 
for their part leinster are boosted by the presence of four players already selected for ireland to play new zealand in dublin on november #
they are brendan mullin the lions centre fergus aherne the scrum-half and the two new caps nick popplewell at loose-head and brian smith the fly-half
no doubt smith the oxford university australian who won five caps for the wallabies will feel a bit closer to home facing the all blacks twice in the next # days
it will be fascinating to see how smith a gifted all-round footballer shapes up in his prospective international partnership with aherne
equally intriguing will be the line-out performance of the young london irish lock neil francis who has been left out ofthe current ireland squad 
fortunately leinster's front five which includes the experienced tight-head prop des fitzgerald looks up to the task of scrummaging against the all blacks
however real problems may arise once leinster attempt to win the loose ball
leinster will be led by their third captain in as many matches the centre paul clinch
leinster f dunlea j sexton p clinch capt b mullin p purcell b smith f aherne n popplewell n kearney d fitzgerald n francis b rigney p kenny k leahy a blair

soccer littlewoods cup fourth round oldham athletic # arsenal # double by ritchie ends #-year wait
by stephen bierley
oldham athletic who had never beaten a first divisionside since they dropped into the second division in # made up for # years of not altogether patient waiting with a pulsating victory over the league champions arsenal at boundary park last night
the pennines fairly shook 
no supporter of the latics dared dream it but suddenly the improbable was a throbbing joyous reality
two goals fromthe irrepressible andy ritchie his #th and #th this season and a third by the #-year-old midfield player nick henry and arsenal were sunk with only the trace of a last-minute goal by quinn
despite many and varied flurries of activity in the first # minutes arsenal seemed reasonably secure if not inspired
they held their line and competed hard in midfield damping down oldham's initial verve and preparing themselves for more of the same in the second half
then oldham struck 
winterburn almost put the ball into his own net from milligan's cross o'leary recovering an awkward situation 
almost immediately smith had an excellent chance for arsenal but stumbled
oldham took up the attack again and barlow who had a fine match atleft-back totally containing rocastle floated in a deep cross beyond winterburn
the predatory ritchie chested the ball down and hammered a volley past lukic
arsenal had no choice but to attack as soon as the second half began 
a neat step-over by rocastle sent thomas hurtling in on goal but rhodes moved sharply off his line to smother the shot 
from the resulting corner rhodes made another fine save hurtling to his right to deflect away dixon's rising shot 
finally with arsenal pressing hard he clawed away quinn's careful header from thomas's drag-back
quinn held his head in disbelief
worse far worse was to follow 
bunn who scored six goals in the previous round against scarborough this time turnedinto the provider putting milligan clear and free
he was hauled back on the edge of the area by o'leary a professional foul for which the arsenal central defender was booked
holden's #th-minute free-kick clattered the wall and the ball fell to henry who drilled a low shot from more than # yards inside lukic's right-hand post
in another # minutes any remaining oldham doubts were dispelled
ritchie passed to irwin and then ran on to head the cross past lukic
arsenal were stitched and stuffed with no question of a fluke
not for the first time this season their defence had been found wanting and oldham exploited the weaknesses to the full owing a special debt to the inspiration and tireless running of henry and milligan
george graham was not amused
he called his team's performance unacceptable
but he also said let's not take any credit away from oldham
they were tremendous and outplayed us in the first half
the plastic pitch is no excuse
we trained on an artificial pitch for two days this week and we should have done a lot better
joe royle the oldham manager was full of praise both for graham and his own team 
george was brilliant he said
he could have blamed this and that but he said we deserved it
the manager's attitude shows why they are champions
he took it on the chin 
one or two people will be ready to put this down to plastic but our goals were nothing to do with plastic
this was a great performanc
we rattled them from the first minute and didn't give them any breathing space 
we were helter-skelter for # minutes and we scored three great goals
in the past we have had cup walks not runs

prototyping is crucial to systems development argues ian richards tailored to fit 
in systemsdevelopment nothing is more fundamental than assessing user requirements
if you don't know what the system is required to do you don't know anything
but many system developers are unable to assess requirements properly
they seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirements are and get an answer that amounts to a draft system specification
a doctor doesn't ask his patient what treatment to prescribe 
the patient can explain only what the problem is
it is the doctor that provides the remedy 
if you ask a user what sort of system he wants you will be met with a blank look
a user may have a deep knowledge of business problems but knowing little about computers has no idea how they should be tackled 
yet analysts are heard asking time and again tell me what you want
we've gone away from the days of systemsimposed by the data processing department this is going to be a systemfor the users
but of course the users don't know what they want so they end up getting another duff system
an effective analyst provides the same service to the business the doctor provides to the patient 
he finds out what the needs of the business are and prescribes the cure 
the user tells the analyst what the problems are and the analyst decides at least in broad terms what the user requires
but the analyst has one great advantage over the doctor
once the user becomes familiar with the proposed system helpful comments come thick and fast 
oh this will be of great help in ordering raw materials but sometimes we get part deliveries could we have an extra facility to deal with those 
and sometimes non-standard discount is given a pig to deal with on the old system but if you could add one extra input box on that screen there
and what about orders not delivered on time
if we could list those we'd have advance warning of shortage problems on the assembly lines two months before they occur
now that would be a great leap forward 
unfortunately you cannot reach this stage until you have developed a prototype system
and you can't develop a prototype systembecause the users haven't got a clue what they want
most of them are probably muttering i'm too busy to get involved in this sort of thing 
what's wrong with the old system anyway
the only way to develop a prototype is for the analyst to get inside the head of the user and thinking like a user decide what sort of system is required
of course the initial system will not be perfect
the analyst cannot hope to understand the business as well in a few weeks as the user does after many years
but once the user sees the system channels of communication will open 
instead of persuading the user to specify requirements the analyst will be driven by the user to meet key needs
good system development goes through two distinct phases 
initially the analyst does all the work leading the user towards a systemhe thinks is right for the business
but once the user sees the potential of the system a change in attitude takes place 
the process becomes demand driven by the user
the analyst is then forced on the defensive explaining why new features cannot be included because they are technically difficult or prohibitively expensive
traditionally systems were validated by users agreeing functional specifications
in theory validation meant that the user had read the specification imagined how the system would work in practice and agreed the design 
it was only when using a test version of the system available just before the planned implementation date that difficulties would come to light and a host of change requests be issued
the advent of fourth generation languages #gls has made system development much easier 
with a #gl an initial prototype can be put together quickly
this means feedback is obtained early in the development process and the system can grow around the user's requirements
crucial to the development process is the relationship built up between the analyst and the user
the best systems arise when both have a deep understanding of each other's jobs
many developers use business analysts to ensure that the development team maintain a proper focus on business requirements
but this can be counter-productive as it cuts off communication between the systemsanalyst and the user
too much specialisation is bad for systemsdevelopment it feeds the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulties and forget about the underlying business needs
if you should stroll into a pub and meet an analyst and a user talking about work and you cannot tell one from the other they have probably developed a successful system together

tiphook confident 
container group tiphook yesterday said it was still confident of winning its joint #million bid for sea containers even though the battle has swung towards james sherwood's ferries-to-trailers combine
the offer from the anglo-swedish consortium formed bytiphook and stena ab is the subject of an appeal in the bermudan courts which is aimed at overturning an earlier ruling allowing seaco to proceed with its poison pill defence 
tiphook which yesterday unveiled a # per cent increase in half year profits to #million hopes the court will block seaco's purchases of its own shares
alternatively it may be able to muster enough support from seaco shareholders to halt the current disposal of assets by mr sherwood for its bid with stena to be fully considered 
the cost of the bid to tiphook is put at #million which it says will have only a minor impact on full year results
increased demand for its road rail and sea container fleets during the first half helped boost the latest figures 
this flowed through to earnings per share up a half at #p and shareholders receivea # per cent increase in the interim dividend to #p
the shares rose #p to #p
salvesen boost
christian salvesen the food process and distribution generator hire and brick making group raised pre-tax profits by almost # per cent to #million in the six months to september
aggreko generator hire salvesen's world market leader which provides power for customers from pop concerts to the oil industry contributed strongly to a # per cent growth in trading profits in the industrial services division
oil slicks in alaska and elsewhere helped vikoma the group's environmental cleaning equipment manufacturer which specialises in separating oil from water and although salvesen brick is suffering in the second half from a # to # per cent cut in demand as housebuilding nosedives the first half was prosperous and full year trading profit should be on a level with # says finance director brian fidler
almost a third of group profits are earned overseas interest and tax charges are down on last year and gearing stands at # per cent
capital spending of # million should reach a total of # million for the full year
the shares rose #p to #p
avon treads warily 
shares in avon rubber have fallen sharply this year as a result of the weak demand for winter tyres and rights issue call to finance the move into us motor components
the sale of most of the lossmaking tyre distribution business to sumitomo now also a minority shareholder in the only british-controlled tyremaker's plant gives the board confidence in some improvement this year despite a poor immediate outlook for the motor producers
pre-tax profit fell #million to # million in the year to september # in line with the severely reduced expectations after the cadillac rubber acquisition and rights issue in july
turnover was held at #million an rise of about #million by the earlier contribution from tyre distribution and the us replacement
the final dividend goes up to #p making #p against #p for the year
earnings crashed by a third to #p
there was an extraordinary gain of # million covering the motorway tyres disposal and more rationalisation costs
in short
whessoe saw pre-tax profit rise to # million from # million on sales of # million down from # million
earnings were level at #p a share
dividends total #p up a penny with a #p final
btp's enlarged specialist chemicals activities boosted turnover to #million from #million in the september half and profit rose to # million from # million including an exceptional # million from the rizzi engineering sale in italy
earnings without such gains were #p higher at #p a share
the interim dividend is #p a rise of # per cent
norcros the property building materials and printing group saw profits crash from #million to #million
however the city had been expecting bad figures and the shares rose #p to #p
hardanger the retail property developer posted pre-tax profits up #million to #million

edoardo amaldi
ragazzi of distinction
in december # the men working feverishly to create the first american atomic bomb sent a team of spooks to naples
one of their main assignments was to contact edoardo amaldi a physicist thought to be in hiding near rome
six months later the day before rome's liberation by the allies amaldi was found
he was interviewed by moe berg then one of the most famous baseball players in america
berg was also an agent of the office of strategic services which was later to give birth to the cia
his job was to convince amaldi to pack his bags because there was a ship waiting at naples to take him to the united states
amaldi's presence there had been sought by two other italian colleagues also physicists
his mentor enrico fermi later to be called the father of the bomb and emilio segre who died in california earlier this year
amaldi dodged the american invitation perhaps because with rome liberated fermi's mantle in physics had fallen on his young shoulders and there were younger minds to teach 
he wore that mantle well at rome university until his retirement in #
but amaldi never really retired nor grew old
he kept regular hours in the university's physics building spoke at scientific meetings this year in moscow and washington
as president of the accademia nazionale dei lincei he had delivered the welcoming address on tuesday to a symposium of scientists
he then ordered a car to call for him the next morning for a similar occasion and was felled by a stroke while waiting for the lift
amaldi grew up in a small town in lombardy and took his doctorate in physics from rome at the remarkably early age of #
in # he became one of the ragazzi di via panisperna the street where fermi's kids carried out their own experiments under the master in their own under-financed lab
emilio segre was one kid and bruno pontecorvo later to defect from britain to the soviet union another
it is interesting to note that the pope as the kids called fermi because he's always right was only seven years older than amaldi
amaldi astounded his group in october # with his discovery that by slowing down rather than accelerating neutrons he could provoke intense nuclear reactions
he held a chair in physics from # until his retirement publishing more than # papers on atomic and nuclear physics
he was awarded honorary degrees by algiers glasgow and oxford
he became a founder and active executive of the european centre for nuclear research in geneva
i had the pleasure of two long talks last year with professor amaldi about his knowledge of what the german physicists were doing with their atoms during the war years
apart for his incongruously white hair amaldi seemed to have the mental lucidity and expected energy of a man half his age
his modesty considering his world-wide fame in his field was endearing
i knew almost nothing about physics but we shared some jokes about the rome telephone system
in # amaldi wrote to the italian prime minister asking for permission to produce and sell sealing wax for letters so that we may raise needed funds for our physics lab
the reply came from an under-secretary who said that the present funding was considered adequate and the commercial undertaking would be ill-advised
it was signed by giulio andreotti the present prime minister

midwife at the birth of a state
the intifada is a people's unarmed revolution against occupation
its two main slogans repeated countless times in the directives issued by the underground leadership are freedom and independence
it has employed a dual strategy to achieve these two objectives 
first a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign was begun by which people severed or minimised all the contact points by which they were bound to the israeli occupation authority
this campaign included resignations of palestinian officials from public posts the boycott of israeli goods and products and the refusal to pay taxes and fines
partial and full strikes demonstrations sit-ins conventions all these have in fact only constituted the outer layer of an inner mechanism of civilian rebellion
the second and complementary part of the intifada strategy concentrated on the construction of an indigenous national authority
as israel's authority was being lifted the population began creating an alternative authority of their own
popular committees were established in villages refugee camps suburbs streets in fact in every community
some headway was made in expanding self-sufficiency whether through utilising more land for agriculture developing home economies or encouraging local manufacturers and products
villages and refugee camps were thus being developed into liberated or independent areas if not militarily then at least psychologically politically and infrastructurally
bloody clashes would occur whenever armoured units raided these villages storming through makeshift defensive road blocks and responding to rocks being thrown with live bullets and tear gas but no sooner would these army units be gone than authority would revert to the village residents
palestinian flags would be raised on minarets and church spires road blocks would again be erected and life in all its aspects would once again be run by the local leadership
the structure of the developing national authority has been both diffuse enough to prevent it from being destroyed by any one single sweep of arrests there have been more than # arrests since the intifada's outbreak and coherent enough to allow for the existence of a unified resistance strategy
while the entire network of popular committees local institutions and the general public the field commanders in the battle of civilian disobedience and of constructing a political infrastructure a rotating unified national command acts in the role of field-general issuing a bi-monthly directive outlining policy and determining specific resistance programmes
a high level of mobility in the structure allows for continuous interchange of roles and ideas and retains for the unified national command the closeness to grass roots that is required to make it truly reflect people's wishes and sentiments
this expanded network of popular committees and institutions making up the unified leadership is infused by tens of thousands of activists who belong to or identify with the different factions of the plo
in effect therefore the plo exists at all levels of organisation within the occupied territories
thus the palestinian national movement both inside and outside the occupied territories is an organic whole
the pattern of the intifada has been cyclical
thrusts of resistance mass demonstrations resignations tax rebellions etc would come in crests 
the pattern is determined by a wide variety of factors including what the israeli army does 
but the relation is complex not uni-directional 
harsh measures putting an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous lengthy period of time demolishing homes uprooting olive or citrus trees physical intimidation and terror tacticsemployed by raiding army units shooting killing cutting off water or electricity supplies and telephone links to villages or towns mass arrests intimidatory interrogation techniques can either create a temporary lull or activate an eruption 
the army never knows which it will be
it is it is walking through a minefield 
the wave pattern of the intifada its pains and sufferings are all of the process of birth 
the metaphor is apt as palestinians regard themselves as engaging in a process of giving birth to their independent palestinian state
through their revolution the masses are both mother and midwife to the birth of this state
the intifada is the midwife of freedom 
through it palestinians are struggling on a daily basis to shake off israel's authority and to construct their own
the struggle reflects a revolution in mass consciousness by which people have come to realise that ideas and aspirations must be embodied in manifest acts if reality is to be changed 
thus wherever one looks one finds people engaged in the construction of the blocks that will make up the palestinian state
it is a conscious effort
the masses are being engaged in the craft of state-masonry 
in this process of state building many stages have been covered 
the declaration of independence issued by the palestine national council pnc on november # last year constitutes a major landmark along this road 
its significance lies in its double message that the aim of the palestinian struggle is the establishment of palestinian independence and that this independence is regarded as being not at israel's expense 
this has been a constant theme of intifada policy that we wish to build palestine not to destroy israel that we wish to achieve freedom for our people not to deprive others israelis of it that we wish to protect and save lives ours not to endanger the lives of others israelis
in one of several intifada leaflets written in hebrew and addressed to the israeli soldiers on duty in the occupied territories the message was repeated soldier go home 
return to your family and children
be with them in peace so that we may remain with our family and children in peace
we do not wish to harm you or your state
we wish to be unharmed in our own state
how can the process of state building be developed 
if the pnc declaration of independence constituted a major landmark in this process the time has come to embark on another major step that of declaring the setting up of a state or government structure 
an escalation of the intifada in this direction would serve two purposes at once
first it would consolidate the structures of the developing national authority which is competing to replace the occupation authority
second it would consolidate the image and essence of the intifada as a constructive not a destructive force 
naturally to embark on such a step is not necessarily to succeed immediately in realising it 
rather it is a challenge 
it will be a further challenge to israel's occupation conceived in the image of earlier challenges of the intifada
but it will also be a challenge to us palestinians summoning us to work more energetically towards the idea's fulfilment
it would be a natural extension of the intifada's dual strategy towards disengagement from israel and the corresponding process of state building 
it would further naturalise and legitimise the evolving skeletal form of palestinian independence
it would provide the multitudinous popular committees and activities with a more advanced form of organisation and structure 
it would enable better planning and performance
it would maximise civilian tactics of resistance and defuse the natural potential for violence containing and eventually eliminating the marginal but intrusive phenomenon of collaborator activation by israeli security authorities and collaborator execution by local palestinians
it would create a further fact that would put israel on the spot 
israel's reaction however hostile could only further our cause
arresting or deporting the tens of thousands of palestinian professionals who would be employed in perfectly apolitical harmless and humanitarian jobs can only further isolate the israeli government
half-way measures can only imply half-way success
a modus vivendi would also imply success
in general our policy should be to proceed with building our state block by block without waiting to be given a gift of it through negotiations
we should regard negotiations rather as the means by which we could establish formal agreements between our state and israel
such agreements can range from the issue of borders to the issue of free wave-lengths for our future television and radio networks
in the meantime we have the capacity to bring coherence and organisation to a whole range of activities further consolidating the institutional linkage between the people in the occupied state and the plo leadership
entire departments can be set up in health foreign affairs agriculture trade finance education justice religion information and social welfare
a pyramid administrative structure establishing links from popular committees in villages right up to the executive committee of the plo in its capacity as a cabinet can be established
during the intifada the people have been engaged in building the side walls 
a government would provide the roof which would bring these walls together 
it would add another necessary touch in the process of creating a palestinian home

the day thrift turned into a nightmare 
by daniel john
george tyson is not a gambling man nor does he take unnecessary risks
he doesn't smoke or drink and even if he wanted to two heart attacks and a by-pass operation have made the decision for him
by his own account mr tyson is thrifty and states quite proudly that neither he or his wife rosie are a burden on any form of social or government support 
but that is why at the age of # mr tyson is not enjoying what he had hoped would be a comfortable retirement
a life of saving had by # given them a small nest-egg of # on which the interest would help supplement their pensions
to the tysons that meant nothing extravagant just an extra # a month to make life at home in south ruislip middlesex easier
that money was invested as might be expected of the tysons
and for three years it earned its return every month
until one morning in june # when george tyson turned on the radio to hear a small investment business called barlow clowes had collapsed 
it was about #am and i was just getting dressed when it came over on the news said mr tyson a former clerk of works at harrow council london
investors in barlow clowes since # the tysons had orginally put # into the uk fund and # in gibraltar-based barlow clowes international bci
fate determined that a short while before the businesses failed they transferred the # to bci because of the better returns being offered
in the days that followed the tysons found that they and # other investors had been the victims of a financial crash of global proportions
of the #million invested inboth funds bci investors faced a shortfall of up to #million
after the initial shock and disbelief the tysons grew angry at the advisers who convinced them about barlow clowes at the midland bank manager who gave verbal assurances of its security at the regulatory authorities responsible for the investment community and at the department of trade and industry which allowed the company to trade
i felt it was so safe they were so professional said mr tyson
i feel appalled bythe way these professional guardians have treatedus
if you were a gambling man it would not affect you it would just be lost 
but this was not a gamble 
like so many investors mr tyson found himself having to go back to work to ease the financial strain he had hoped to avoid 
ironically it was the government which he partly blamed for the affair that gave him the chance to return to work after retirement
a change in the tax rules affecting pensions was shortly followed bya job with the department of environment's property services agency a post which carries him through to march and may see him stay until he is #
putting it as politely as he can mr tyson said the whole affair encouraged him to return to paid employment
i hadn't planned to work at all
and like all of the other investors he and his wife were in a quandry
they wanted to do something but felt powerless
pursuing legal action would have cost them money they didn't have unless it meant selling their house which was not an option but doing nothing left them with the feeling that justice wasn't being done
so they compromised and gave # to the barlow clowes investors groupwhich was formed last july to represent the investors' interests and co-ordinate the fight for compensation
that says mr tyson has been their only blessing 
they are dedicated people who clearlyknow what they are talking about and have guided us through it
those people are victims too but they have certainly kept us together 
that aside the last year has brought littlerespite from their own very personal crisis 
the tysons have yet to seeany cash payment fromthe liquidators who have been winding up bci's affairs
what little money has been recovered remains the subject of a legal tussle in the courts which may yet take months to resolve
they have been told that their claim may only amount to around # of their # as capital gains tax is likely to be deducted from the total
but until they get any money back the tysons find themselves in the position of the gambler who gambled all and lost 
except that the tysons don't gamble 
the boy and the dog skirted round opposite sides of the puddle the boy a light tall fourteen-year-old labouring in wellington boots too large for him and the dog a three-year-old labrador bitch picking her way reluctantly with frequent pauses as if her paws hurt
the boy unlike the dog knew that the mud did not go on for ever beyond the bridge the disused railway embankment along which they were walking became built up so that water ran off it
he pulled the dog close to him to let a mixed string of horses and ponies go past waving shyly to the lead rider a pretty capable girl an unbridgeable two years older than him
he watched her as she went past at a walk the black labrador and he both gazing wistfully their breath steaming in the cold february morning
he waited till the horses were well away and looked round the wide flat landscape carefully before unclipping the lead
way you go patty he said softly and the dog was off hurling herself along the embankment all paws and flying ears after a rabbit who had been sitting in a patch of sun but disappeared with contemptuous ease as she came close
the boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead the riding-school only used the land by grace of its owner and it was a shooting estate but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come to his call
he stood for a moment laughing at her as she cast furiously for the vanished rabbit and walked on to catch her up along the raised embankment
the trees had grown up beside it in the twenty-five years since the railway had closed and the boy stopped every now and then to watch small birds hopping around the top branches
he particularly liked this stretch nothing but the odd tractor and the horses ever came down this embankment and the birds were unworried by his presence 
after half a mile he decided to turn off the embankment and walk up the side of the next field and along the path at the top of it following the horses whom he could still see in the distance
he called patty to him
she didn't come which was surprising she was a docile creature and particularly devoted to him because he always took her for a walk when he was at the stables
he could hear her barking and looked down over the steep side of the embankment to the bottom of the trees
he called her again and again but she would not stop barking at something he could not see
probably a squirrel he decided and slithered down the side of the embankment to join her scolding as he went
straightening up beside the dog he looked where she was looking and blinked
he saw a leg uncomfortably wedged between sapling trees swollen grotesquely and gazed at it stupidly wondering if it was plastic
as his eyes focused he realized he was looking at a hideously swollen human body and just then as the light breeze shifted he caught the stomach-turning odour of decay
he was a sensible and capable boy an eldest child so he moved closer trying not to breathe and stood steadfastly looking until he was confident of what he had seen a body must be a girl because it was wearing a skirt lying face down head towards the bottom of the embankment as if she had dived off the top
he clipped the lead on to the dog with cold hands which would hardly function and let her pull him up the slope as fast as he could make his legs move
he stopped on the embankment shaking with cold and shock to note the spot then fled along the tractor paths the dog running with him to the stables where the ten o'clock children's ride was in its closing stages 
miss williams
jamie i'm teaching
the thin capable woman who was taking the riding-class looked at him in amazement as he leaned panting on the gate to the ring the dog whining beside him
i'm sorry
please i've found something i must tell you 
she had known him since he was a very small five-year-old perched a mosquito on one of the placid beginners' ponies so she told the class to carry on walking their ponies while she came to him
there's someone dead
below the railway embankment
are you sure
the boy looked at her and uncontrollable tears suddenly filled his eyes
he was very nearly as tall as her but she put an arm under his shoulders and supported him to the untidy room which served as the stable office calling to one of the stable girls to take over the class
patty found her
she's just lying there but she is dead
he scrubbed at his face with the handkerchief she offered and gulped for air
i'll ring the police
she did so casting an experienced eye over him
sit down here jamie and i'll make some tea
mummy will come back in a few minutes won't she for susie
not mummy
aunt margaret is coming at ten
the boy thought longingly of his mother but managed to help miss williams describe the location of the body to a startled local station sergeant and to drink a cup of sweet milky tea without being sick
by the time his aunt arrived jamie was so far recovered as to be able to refuse to go home and to point out severely that he would be needed either to assist the police or to be lead rider in the eleven-thirty class or possibly both
he watched his aunt and miss williams wordlessly consult each other but knew his aunt would do as she was told successful solicitor though she was she was ten years younger than miss williams and as she complained totally intimidated by her as she had not been by anyone since her late headmistress
he was unsurprised to find her packed off firmly to take his sister home leaving him as a person of major importance in what he instantly assumed to be a real murder
miss williams took him to meet the police land rover at the stable gate a bone-thin wiry woman in her late fifties her expression sufficiently forbidding to prevent the parents edging cars through the gate to collect children from the ten o'clock ride from asking any questions
jamie through a renewed queasiness just observed that the police driver was instantly reduced to half his age by miss williams's greeting
he was one of my boys she said in explanation to the cid sergeant who was leading the party as they bumped over the rough road through the thick mud and on to the dry embankment
like jamie here
did you recognize the person you found young man the sergeant asked carefully
no
tears started into jamie's eyes
she was all swollen
the sergeant's eyes widened and he slid out of the land rover and stood back to let jamie out
very competent boy
almost a professional singer handles himself very well
miss williams's natural pitch well suited to reaching across a hunting-field was discreetly reduced 
the cid sergeant thanked her gravely and went to stand beside jamie who was peering down the embankment looking pinched
we'll go down together lad
there isn't room
i'll lead
he took a deep breath and headed down the sergeant two constables and miss williams in his wake 
soon they all stood side by side one of the younger policemen coughing involuntarily
oh dear oh dear miss williams said on an indrawn breath
sorry
come along jamie let's get you back
she took out a handkerchief and mopped her eyes
the police driver shot jamie a look of enquiry which he missed occupied as he was with guiding miss williams back up the hill
he had seen her weep before but only for a sick horse and he was awe-struck
jamie did you let patty off the lead
the boy blushed to his ears and owned to it
you must not do it jamie we'll be in trouble with colonel james i've told all you boys a thousand times
he'll perhaps not do it again the sergeant murmured and received the look that miss williams habitually bent on a child who was riding carelessly
how long had she been there
jamie asked anxiously 
a few days the sergeant said grimly
how many
doctor'll tell us
he considered the boy thoughtfully and decided to take him back quickly
these teenagers were in his experience a lot less tough than they looked
any idea who it could be he asked miss williams casually
no
but only a local would know to put a body there
if jamie hadn't let the dog off the lead she could have been there much longer
the sergeant nodded deciding it could do no harm to concede a point he had already taken 
no one could tell who she was surely
miss williams said quietly to him sounding shaky
she didn't even look 
the sergeant confirmed that that happened with bodies after a few days
we'll identify her though he said reassuringly
somebody will likely have reported her missing
he stopped abruptly as he remembered a conversation earlier that week and lit a cigarette thinking furiously 
this could be the girl whom the yard were looking for and he had better do everything very quickly indeed including finding his chief who would then want to find chief constable and notify scotland yard
presumably it would be the yard who investigated this one rather than the regional crime squad 
he chewed his thumbnail as he walked out of long experience keeping in mind the highest priorities ensure body not moved and ensure next of kin notified before the press got the story
he posted the detective constable he had with him back down the path to join his colleague armed with instructions to repel all attempts by anyone however senior or armed with whatever authority to go anywhere near the body unless he sergeant black personally accompanied them
then he climbed into the land rover beside his two passengers and drove off fast with the aim of abandoning jamie to the custody of his aunt as quickly as possible
he could see with half an eye that the kid's aunt was going to be one of the confident bossy well-connected women with whom that part of cambridgeshire was substantially over- 
john mcleish was in his office saturday or no saturday telling himself he needed to catch up on the paperwork
the phone rang and he picked it up frowning
one of the pleasures of saturday working was that the phone did not ring all the time
the voice at the other end was plainly over-excited and it took him a minute to disentangle what he was being told
oh congratulations charlie
sorry what did you say it was again
a little girl
actually a very big girl as these things go nine pounds
it's fantastic john there she is a new person lying on her face sound asleep
i've just left them and i'm going back 
mcleish repressed the malicious thought that this event might putfrancesca's nose just a little bit out of joint 
she had been utterly secure in her position as the only girl in the wilson family and now there was another one
i've got another bit of good news
frannie's going to be able to bring tristram home pretty soon apparently
mcleish expressed qualified enthusiasm and charlie assured him he felt exactly the same about his younger brother
the difficulty is that perry does everything that bit better than tristram
not that this is any excuse john i know
he paused mcleish irresistibly of a labrador wondering how best to approach an acquaintance 
i wanted to say you see that i know you thought frannie shouldn't have gone and that it's ruined your holiday plans and on behalf of us all i'm sorry
i know the little boys lean on her too much and would have gone if i could
he coughed embarrassed and a little pompous very much conscious of his new status as a father while mcleish remembered that he was a scant four years older than the delinquent tristram
anyway she should be back soon charlie concluded
mcleish thanked him gravely feeling as he often did with the wilsons that he was being enveloped in a large feather eiderdown and made restless by the call went down the corridor to where he knew catherine crane was also in getting her office in order 
he stopped at the door and smiled at her
wearing jeans and a blue shirt she was tugging at a filing cabinet which was too large for her to embrace and which was threatening to over-balance on her
she looked about sixteen and beautiful
she let go of the cabinet coughing in the dust of ages that appeared to be lurking behind it and smiled back at him as the february sun shone through the small window behind her throwing into sharp relief the patches on the wall where her predecessor had hung posters and the ingrained dirt on the flaking paintwork round the mean narrow metal window
where do you want that put
mcleish advanced on the cabinet and shifted it authoritatively ignoring the clip on the ankle dealt him by an unsecured bottom drawer apparently full of bricks 
i should have unloaded it first catherine crane said apologetically but i just couldn't move in any direction with it where it was
i'm here just tell me if you want anything else shifted
he hesitated
i'm going todo another hour then have some lunch if you want to come
he was aware that he was not managing to sound exactly like a senior officer making a recent arrival feel at home but decided not to add any further riders to his invitation
that would be very nice
are we going to the canteen
not if i can help it
what about the pub
if i'm allowed to buy my own
mcleish considered
that's fine on the food i'll buy the drinks i'm too old to get used to women buying my drinks
she laughed at him and said gravely that she would be happy to indulge him and he went away grinning
peter yeo was also in his office having told his wife he was lunching with a client
it was he felt just too difficult to be at home at all with claudia in a permanently bitchy mood and both his teenage children taking their cue from her and behaving intolerably
he wandered restlessly about and decided that the lie might as well become the truth
without angela morgan at least two major clients were in danger of not getting the assiduous service they were paying for and it would be well worth trying to see if one of them whom he knew to be a fellow refugee from family life at the weekends could be found
he was in luck and fixed to meet andy barton at brazzo's where yeo davis had a table permanently booked 
he had to admit that this particular client hardly added to the general decorative smartness of the place
andy barton founder and chief executive of barton textiles was almost as broad as he was long virtually neckless with incongruously long brown hair curling over his collar
his enormous hands dwarfed the elegant menu which he was studying in apparent disbelief and peter yeo noticed again as barton without rising extended one massive paw that though the fingers were an ordinary length it was the width of the palms that made the hands so large
i never see how they get the sales per square foot in these places barton observed without further greeting
i mean they're not open twelve hours like my shops and they aren't using the space
his small bright blue eyes swept disparagingly over the minimalized black and white flooring stainless steel chairs and black wooden bar
they make a huge margin on a smaller turnover andy out of punters like us
peter yeo was amused by and respectful of a man with an obsession
angela not working today
barton worked a sixteen-hour day which began with careful detailed consideration of the trading figures and key ratios for every one of his forty-three major shops and the output of both factories and continued usually by helicopter with a detailed aerial survey of a particular area as the quick way of identifying new sites interspersed with unheralded descents on the manager of any shop he took a fancy to visit
peter yeo who had known this particular juggernaut since he had his first small factory and two stores and dirt under his fingernails from shifting packing-cases personally was not fazed by the question
angela's taking a few days off she hasn't been well he said easily 
i know she's been working very hard for you
i'm up to speed with huerter of course but is your planning application in leicester all right
barton assured him warmly that angela had done a great job and he was now confident of getting planning permission on the vast site he had wanted
peter yeo who knew him in this over- over- mood decided to prod gently
angela said the council wanted it for housing
yeah some of them did
silly buggers it's jobs they want there first
plenty of housing if those stupid farts at the council got round to repairing it and stopped their tenants tearing apart what they have got
my mum brought up five of us in a flat far worse than what these immigrants complain about 
peter yeo who had personally persuaded barton of the presentational disadvantage of using words like darkies niggers or wogs decided that immigrants even though used in the manner of one invoking a curse was as good as he was going to get with this particular client
she's doing a good job on sorting this huerter thing too
bloody ridiculous them blokes at the dti pushing assistance for huerter
i voted for this government because they said they weren't going to go in for that sort of rubbish 
no one ever gave me anything and my business works 
still angie can fix the treasury on this one given her boyfriend can't she
that's the reason i wanted you on this 
peter yeo winced inwardly but he was not going to tell andy barton that angela was missing or express any of his reservations about how much influence angela could bring to bear 
he smoothly changed the subject to the looks of the blond model three tables away and barton agreed he wouldn't mind a bit of that on the thin side mind you but tasty 
the rest of lunch passed in similar diversion interspersed with details of last week's turnover which were never far from barton's mind whatever other distractions offered 
mrs huntley was having lunch with her daughter
she ate placidly acknowledging to herself with her customary good sense that at the moment as at any time since her brother william had died she and penelope were getting no pleasure at all from each other's company
penelope was looking particularly discontented and disaffected picking at her food
her red suit was smart but too bright a colour for her pale english pink and white skin her brown hair could have done with a wash and her nails were ragged and bitten
she was frowning deep lines appearing between her eyebrows mouth drawn down at the edges so that instead of a classically good-looking slim english rose in her late twenties she looked faded years older than her real age and shrewish
mrs huntley sighed her brother whom she had loved but knew to be self-indulgent to a fault had done his niece real harm by leaving so much of his money away from the girl who had confidently believed herself to be his favourite thing on earth
penelope however it had to be acknowledged had made no attempt to rise above the blow she had been dealt by finding a dazzling girl of her own age favoured over herself in her uncle's will 
at least mrs huntley thought hopefully she had stopped wondering unbecomingly and stridently how her uncle could have been fooled by angela morgan
it was grizel huntley's own view that her brother had not been fooled at all but had been charmed and diverted by a dashing girl thirty years his junior and had seen no reason at all why she should not have a share of his considerable estate when that left a very decent down-setting for his niece as well
indeed she had respected angela morgan for the straightforwardness with which she had tackled the issue when they had met at the lawyer's office
i'm sorry you're disappointed she had said to penelope but after all there's a lot of money quite enough for both of us
so there was grizel huntley acknowledged and it would be a great deal better if penny could manage to think a bit more positively
if she has vanished i'm going to see that solicitor about whether i can get her presumed dead
penny sounding childishly sullenly determined broke into her mother's thoughts
grizel huntley looked across at her shocked 
i would wait a little if i were you
penelope glared at her turning an ungraceful scarlet but mrs huntley held her ground 
you are being silly about this penny
you are letting this disappointment and that's all it is you're still a very well-off young woman get in the way of everything
penelope choked on her pudding and started to cry angry uncontrollable tears
grizel huntley reached out to comfort her but she forced back her chair and fled clutching her handbag and napkin leaving her mother with the ruins of lunch
fifty miles north sarah morgan had just finished serving a lunch that no one had done more than pick at
her husband francis had made a slightly better showing than her daughter jennifer who was looking particularly ragged 
mother and daughter were very like each other tall dark slim pleasant-looking women with mid-brown curly hair and slightly snub noses
francis morgan by contrast was dark almost black-haired sallow-skinned with bright brown eyes
of medium height and packed with energy even distressed as he was he was bursting round the kitchen hair still damp at the back from his swim
let's go to the flicks
no point at all sitting round looking at each other
come on jennifer or are you going out with michael
he's gone back to australia dad
last week
jennifer sounded defeated and he looked at her sideways with familiar love and exasperation
she just didn't seem to be able to hang on tomen he thought impatiently not like his angie wherever she was
giles rang up his daughter volunteered and he was uncomfortably reminded by something in her voice that giles hawick was one of the men jennifer hadn't been able to hang on to or not once he had seen angela
how was he his wife sarah asked rather too quickly
well very worried
he said the police were talking to everyone angie had seen in the two weeks before she well vanished and so far had come up with nothing
i mean no one noticed anything unusual about her and she seemed to be full of plans for the wedding
well i told them that francis morgan said irritably and his wife and daughter caught each other's eye in silent agreement that he hadn't told them that angela was refusing point-black to be married from home and was insisting on the full london set-out reception at the house of commons replying unanswerably when he had objected on grounds of expense that she could well afford to pay for it herself
a row of epic proportions had ensued which he and angela had evidently enjoyed but which had left sarah and jennifer sick with distress
i don't want to go out frank
someone might ring 
sarah morgan was sounding diffident but resolute and as morgan opened his mouth to protest in exasperation the doorbell rang
both women looked at him in joint appeal and he marched to the door pulling it open with unnecessary force
he stood door in hand checked by something in the way his visitors a man and a woman were standing
the man a stocky greying fifty-year-old in a navy raincoat over a suit his hair cut short was attended by a uniformed policewoman hair smartly set under the cap her eyes watchful in the wide flat placid face and both of them were standing square and stolid 
francis morgan stood and stared at them and even before the man stepped forward steadily hand extended mouth opening to speak he understood who they were and what they had come to tell him 
mark sanders returned from istanbul feeling exhausted depressed and ill
the blinding headaches he had been experiencing in recent weeks were taking their toll and he looked grey and drawn when he arrived home
lately georgina had been worried bythe general deterioration in his appearance
but now she was visibly shocked by the drained and haggard-looking face which kissed her
she wanted to say you look awful darling but decided against it
what kind of a trip have you had she asked instead
oh not too bad he replied wearily
she took his suitcase and placed it at the bottom of the stairs
come into the kitchen and we will have a cup of tea
i've so much news to tell you
all sorts of things seem to have happened while you have been away this time
mark smiled thinly and kissed her affectionately on the cheek
tell me about it he replied
i could do with a good laugh
why darling
what's the matter
trouble at t'mill
mark slipped an arm around her slim waist as they walked from the hall into the kitchen
perhaps it's old montezuma's revenge he replied
must be getting too old for this globe-trotting lark or else my mis-spent youth is catching up on me
i'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that this is a young man's game 
nonsense mark
you're still a young man well youngish she said trying to tease him out of his apparent lethargy and depression 
let's have that cup of tea and you'll feel better
ah fill the cup what boots it to repeat how time is slipping underneath our feet he quoted with a sigh 
oh darling
what a sad sack we are today
is that how you feel 
shall i accompany you on the violin
now let me tell you all the news
she poured the tea
christopher has been promoted after only one year
the chairman of the company told him he was most impressed with the contribution he's made to the business and that he could go right to the top if he keeps it up 
i knew you'd be delighted to hear that 
she sipped her tea
next
i've found a super husband for harriet
champion of the breed at crufts last year
lives in the next village believe it or not
absolutely magnificent dog
lucky harriet said mark
what else
ah yes a secretary at the ministry of industry wants you to ring him
seems they want you to address the european commission on european industrial development 
in dublin i think she said
something about the factors which influence multi-nat location decisions
anyway you'll know what it means when you see it
i've written it all down 
oh and yes a chap from conservative central office rang up to say they'd like to know if you would be prepared to stand for the european parliament
he sounded somewhat to the right of genghis khan
i said i didn't think so as you were rather busy but i'd pass the message on 
hope i did the right thing 
i said you never knew where you were from one week to the next
he said that would do nicely
just like the american express advertisement
perfect credentials apparently for european parliamentarians
now what next
the chicheley-smythes have bought an absolutely super villa in sardinia and say we could rent it if we'd like to
i've seen the photographs
gorgeous location overlooking a quiet bay
it sleeps ten with a permanent staff of three
only a thousand pounds a week yacht included 
i'd love that for two or three weeks wouldn't you
we wouldn't want to stint ourselves mark said facetiously four or five i should think
and we could take the family she said
we haven't had a family holiday for years
i'd like that 
but we can talk about that later
and i've decided to take up riding again
don't ask me why
just got the urge that's all 
she gave him a beautiful smile which lit her lovely face
well how's that for starters she asked
he had heard that expression before 
is there more
now let me see 
ah yes
andrew's coming home for the weekend so i thought it would be nice to have a drinks party
i've invited the bunkers if that's all right
i like clem and gwen and the girls would be nicer company for andrew
fine agreed mark without much enthusiasm
if clem can make it that is
i heard about this latest merseyside strike in istanbul
could finish off the uk vehicle division he said forlornly and don peters he added shaking his head
some of the stupid bastards won't be satisfied until we no longer make a single vehicle in the uk
then i suppose they'll say it's all management's fault and people will believe them
and who the hell is management he demanded his voice rising 
people like me who've worked their guts out to expand the business while the militant bastards have been working their guts out to destroy it
georgina was nodding agreement
she patted his wrist
i'm quite sure you're right dear
but we weren't talking about the motor industry and the never-ending management-union saga 
we were talking about andrew coming home for the weekend and having the bunkers round for drinks
and i do wish you wouldn't swear like that when you talk about business 
you never used to swear you know
at least you didn't when you were with me
but you do now darling and i do wish you wouldn't
you are becoming so hard and bitter and it's not really like you
mark sighed
i'm sorry
it's just
it's just that there really is trouble at t'mill she said quietly
that's it isn't it
you weren't going to tell me
you were just going to worry about it alone
you let me go rabitting on 
he hugged her kissed her cheek
i'm not sure yet that there really is something to worry about 
but you think there is
he nodded
i have a horrible feeling that um is about to reorganise world-wide planning operations and if that happens it's curtains for the european organisation and for me
curtains she said
what exactly would that mean 
early retirement
mark you're not serious
i think it could be on the cards 
they could transfer me to detroit or somewhere
i don't know but i don't like the signs 
oh mark she said
they wouldn't do that to you
they just couldn't
not after all you've done for the corporation
they couldn't be that unfair and ruthless
his expression was wry
my dear they'll do whatever they feel is necessary to do
sentiment loyalty service and track record none of these things will come into it
georgina took him in her arms and kissed him on the lips
it's all so ridiculous that we're not going to even think about it any more she said firmly hiding her fears
now come into the garden she added smiling
i want to show you the clematis
it's a mass of colour
lying in bed that evening they talked a lot about their life together
they recalled their first days
the county ball
the paul jones and the emotional somersaults when the music stopped and they came face to face for the very first time
the wedding
the birth of their first son adam and then christopher and andrew
the children growing up with all the laughter and tears
schooldays and the void they both felt when the boys went off to boarding school followed by the joy unconfined when they came home at the end of term
mark's promotions and progress up the company ladder 
new and changing homes
friends lost and friends gained 
family achievements and disappointments
notwithstanding current problems which they discussed lightly it had all been wonderful
they fell asleep in the early hours of the morning holding hands 
the next day mark arrived back at um's european headquarters in london and received an early call from muldoon
he went down the airless corridor to his boss's office said hello to the secretary and walked into the large oak-panelled room which was as big as the lobby of many a sizeable hotel
muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched
hello mark
have a good trip
he took the englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chairs arranged around a long rectangular coffee table
instinctively mark felt uneasy
why the hand on the arm and the over- approach 
muldoon never emerged from behind his desk to greet colleagues
only visitors and vips got that special reception 
muldoon poured the coffee
how did the planning meeting go 
mark asked him
what was nate's reaction 
did he and the committee go along with my proposals he added 
it went fine muldoon said
he seemed somewhat uneasy
klepner did a good job 
how did he handle the questions
mark asked
he doesn't have the inside knowledge to deal with questions
oh ok really
i handled some and so did mueller
but klepner did ok
he didn't let the side down 
mark nodded
what was mueller doing answering questions
he was there to ask them
he doesn't know the inside track any more than klepner
maybe not but he soon will muldoon replied quietly
and what does that mean 
muldoon seemed to be taking a long time over his coffee
he evaded mark's eyes
he's goin' to head-up world planning operations from detroit
he's already co-ordinating the regional plans to provide a world picture 
so what's changed
deep down he knew
he's not going to just co-ordinate and consolidate any longer muldoon said with increasing nervousness
he's gonna plan direct and control worldwide planning operations from detroit including the regional planning functions
mark's expression was one of faked incredulity
his gut feelings had been right
you've got to be joking he scoffed
i know that's what mueller's always wanted but nate and the executive committee would never fall for that bloody empire-building game 
the regions are far too big and complex to be handled from detroit and even if they were foolish enough to believe that they could do it more effectively which they can't they would be crazy to try
i know mark i know muldoon said
but that's what they're gonna do
it will boomerang the englishman said heatedly 
overseas governments and local nationals just won't stand for it particularly when they get to know what's going on 
that's one corporate plan that can't win not in the long term
i know mark
but they think they can run everything from detroit and that's the way the organisation is going to be restructured
they are working on it right now
we will know the details in a few weeks time
couple of months at the latest
mark said quietly
and how does that affect the european organisation 
the organisation will be wound up 
i'm taking early retirement
and me
muldoon shrugged
not certain yet
but my guess is early retirement too unless you're prepared to go back to divisional work
local md perhaps
the englishman snorted
you know i can't go back 
who the hell can
in any case you know as well as i do that the mds are always american
well there won't be any european job functions that's for sure muldoon said
there'll be a direct link between detroit and the line managers in each country with detroit calling the shots 
don't they realise they're playing with political dynamite 
mark demanded
mueller won't give a damn about the effect of a corporate plan on europe and on individual countries
if he wants to import vehicles or components from taiwan or singapore or hong kong into europe he'll go ahead and do it regardless of the economic consequences for the european countries concerned
the only thing you can be sure of is that us interest will always come first
oh and there's one more thing you can be sure of he added sourly 
they won't plan to supply the us market from imports
you can bet your bottom dollar on that 
jesus wept he continued hackles rising 
mueller will have the power to make or break whole areas of europe
he's the last guy in the world who should be given such power 
the bloody man's power drunk already
he was angry and bitter 
i know muldoon agreed sadly
then what are you and clancy doing about it
look mark muldoon said forlornly what's the point 
the wheels have already been set in motion 
we're not gonna change anyone's mind
you know that 
his tone was abject
sorry you're takin it so bad he added miserably
how else should i take it
mark demanded
it's my life which is about to go down the plughole 
i'm not an american on a brief overseas assignment
i've spent my entire working life in the european components business 
i've grown up in it
it's in my blood 
i've built plants and managed them
designed products and marketed and sold them
when i was an apprentice there were two component plants in europe and now there are seventeen and i've had a hand in establishing the last twelve
what the hell do you expectme to say
oh is that what they are proposing to do
well bully for mueller and the corporation
i'll go and collect my hat and coat 
i know how you feel mark muldoon said sadly
do you pat
do you
you're sixty-one and have been looking forward to retirement
i'm fifty and have a long way to go
i don't think you can see things the way i see them
well perhaps not muldoon agreed
but i can understand how you feel 
the englishman nodded and poured himself more coffee
so what's going to happen to the european plan he asked 
mueller will drive it from detroit with one or two amendments agreed at the epc meeting muldoon told him
what amendments
no further plant investment in the uk
i suppose mueller saw to that mark said sarcastically
he really hates our guts 
god help the british plants under the new regime 
muldoon shook his head
no it wasn't that 
it was the strike at merseyside
that was the last straw as far as nate was concerned
up until that news hit the committee don had won the day with his uk vehicle division proposals
but as soon as nate heard about the latest strike that was it
end of story 
he instructed mueller to phase-out vehicle manufacture in the uk
mark nodded
how did don take it
he was beginning to win through
he's very upset
naturally
it's the first time in his career he hasn't come out on top 
mueller is taking over the plan and don is being transferred back to the states
public relations job or something similar
just think of it a man of his talent and ability stooging around the media
so when's he going back to the states
mark said
it won't be announced for a week or so but he's already been told
he'll fly out inside the month
and what do you and i do now
mark enquired
start emptying the files
muldoon made a face 
afraid so
klepner will take over the files and ship them back to the states
he'll be mueller's european components planning manager in detroit
klepner
mark uttered in mock astonishment
the man knows nothing about europe
he's a novice 
a bloody charlatan
i know it sounds crazy mark muldoon said
but there it is
we have no choice in the matter
i was instructed to tell you and i have
new york and detroit will come up with an attractive separation package you can be sure of that 
they've already told me you'll get the maximum terms permitted under british law
the corporation wants to do the right thing by you 
the two men rose from the table together
sure
we have no choice in the matter said the englishman
there has to be losers as well as winners said the american
i guess we're both losers mark
the englishman returned to his own palatial office and sat with his head in hands
another of his blinding headaches had developed and he felt a tight sensation in his chest which made breathing very painful and difficult
his secretary entered the room
can i get you a coffee mr sanders
you don't look at all well
shall i get the doctor
he looked up and smiled
no thank you millie
i'm all right
just a headache
be ok in a minute
would love a cup of coffee though
are you sure i shouldn't get a doctor she asked
no thank you
i'll be ok
it's only a headache
millie had her reasons for being concerned
the petticoat mafia at the top of the organisation always knew what was going on often before the top executives themselves
millie and the secretaries of pat muldoon and clancy mcgillicuddy were all close friends
they had got together over the weekend to discuss the implications of the confidential letter the two americans had received from randy mueller on behalf of nate cocello
major changes were afoot which affected their respective bosses
by the time mark reached home that evening the pains in his head were excruciating
he decided against telling georgina about his meeting with muldoon
he would wait for the right moment
this wasn't it 
homicide
this chapter deals with the approach of the criminal law to behaviour which causes or risks causing death
murder manslaughter and several other offences are discussed and one recurrent issue here is whether english law responds proportionately to the different degrees of culpability manifested in cases where death is caused
# death and finality
for practical purposes the culpable causing of another person's death may fairly be regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar 
there is an argument that treason is a more serious offence since it strikes at the very foundations of the state and its social organizations but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treathomicide as the most serious form of crime
the reason for this is not difficult to find the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to a degree whereas the harm caused byhomicide is absolutely irremediable
even in crimes of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects the victim retains his or her life and therefore the possibility of further pleasures and achievements whereas death is final
this finality makes it proper to regard death as the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm as the most culpable of offenders in the absence of some excuse or justification
although many deaths arise from natural causes and many others from illnesses and diseases each year sees a large number of deaths caused byaccidents and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount to some form of homicide in english law
for # the statistics show that there were some # accidental deaths of which some # occurred in the home # at work and # on the roads
by comparison the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was # which includes all the murders and manslaughters
this figureis relatively small when compared with many american cities but that is no cause for satisfaction
there are still awkward questions to be confronted 
for example are we satisfied that the # deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable than all or even most of the deaths recorded as accidents
in other words does english criminal law pick out the most heinous forms of killing as murders and manslaughters or are the boundaries frozen by tradition
another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in its application to activities which carry some risk of causing death than in other spheres 
thus even if it would be excessive to sweep large numbers of the deaths now recorded as accidents into the law of homicide there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offences designed to ensure safe conditions of work safe goods safe buildings and so on
it was argued in chapter # that the criminal law ought to spread its net wider where the potential harm is greater 
it will be seen that english law does this up to a point and in the process seems to accept social-defence arguments as reasons for departing from several of the principles set out in chapter #
# requirements of criminal homicide
english law distinguishes between the offences of murder and manslaughter as we shall see but the two crimes do have certain common elements 
it must be proved that the defendant's act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day
the requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere 
the year and a day rule is a legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that if there was a substantial lapse of time between injury and death it was unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant's conduct or some other event caused the death
nowadays the problem is quite the reverse medical science is generally able to determine whether d's conduct caused the death and innovations such as life-support machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years in some instances
in one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half years after the incident having been kept on a life-support machine for almost the entire time
in principle it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case if all the other elements can be established and only the year and a day rule stands in the way 
but the rule was confirmed by the criminal law revision committee in # on the ground that a defendant should not be left in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely
surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years after the event
the rule itself is out accord with modern medical conditions and should be abolished
defining murder the inclusionary question
a the procedural context 
if causing death is to be regarded as the most serious harm that can be inflicted it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentences imposed by the courts
indeed many systems of criminal law impose a mandatory sentence for murder or whatever the highest form of homicide is called in that system 
in some jurisdictions this is a mandatory sentence of death
in others such as those in the united kingdom it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment
why should this penalty be mandatory and not at the discretion of the court as in other offences
one argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amounts to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder
it places the offender under the state's control as it were for the remainder of his or her life
this is often linked with a supposed denunciatory effect the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces murder as emphatically as possible and with a supposed general deterrent effect in declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime
it might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes a substantial contribution to public safety
none of these arguments is notably strong let alone conclusive
the mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to capture the worst killings and only the worst killings remains to be discussed below 
whether the life sentence is regarded as a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public's perception of what life imprisonment means if it is widely believed that it results in an average of nine years' imprisonment the effect will be somewhat blunted 
the same applies to the general deterrent argument its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the calculations of potential killers at all and if it does whether life imprisonment is seen as significantly more or less severe than the alternative of a long fixed- sentence
as for public protection this depends on executive decisions with regard to release it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep lifers in for so long 
this brings the discussion to a crucial point what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice and what would be the alternative
what it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the home secretary on the advice of the parole board and the lord chief justice rather than by the judge at the trial
in procedural terms therefore the life sentence involves a transfer of function normally it is the judge who determines the sentence or at least its upper limit since earlier release on parole may be possible whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive who must first ascertain the opinions of the lord chief justice and the trial judge
the home office is not bound by those opinions and appears to depart from them frequently
in # the home secretary imposed restrictions on the release of persons serving life for murders of policeand prison-officers terrorist killings murder during robbery and the sadistic or sexual murder of young children fixing a minimum of twenty years' imprisonment for these offenders
whatever the justifications for introducing this policy it serves to underline the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually after hearing representations from the offender's counsel and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal
at present the executive takes decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long periods
should those decisions not be taken by the courts in the same way as other sentencing decisions
the answer sometimes given is that murderers should be treateddifferently because they are particularly dangerous anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again
but this argument will seem less persuasive when we have discussed cases of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility where a murder is reduced to manslaughter the judge has a wide sentencing discretion and may according to the facts of the case select a determinate prison sentence a hospital order or life imprisonment
those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than those convicted of murder and yet the judge has sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other
considerations of this kind have led the houseof lords select committee on murder and life imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder
in its place would be a sentencing discretion which judges would use in many cases to mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence
in cases where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence the trial judge would still specify in open court the number of years to be spent in prison taking the gravity of the offence into account and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal
such a reform would bring improvements in natural justice without loss of public protection
b degrees of homicide
english criminal law has two degrees of homicide murder and manslaughter
many american jurisdictions have three degrees of murder first-degree murder requiring premeditation and secondand third-degree murder covering lesser shades of culpability
in england there has been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinctions leaving a single offence of criminal homicide
that proposal if implemented would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone
the jury would have no role in most homicide cases since a plea of guilty would be the norm
contrast this with the position in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees of homicide pleas of guilty to firstand second-degree murders would be less frequent since there would be the possibility of argument in court if no bargain was struck beforehand between prosecution and defence and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing
moreover the borderlines between the various degrees would raise questions of law which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals
the result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way but at the cost of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills 
that cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for first-degree murder
where there is no capital punishment however the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling see chapter # l against the cost and time arguments mobilised bythe policy of efficient administration see chapter # m
the structure of the english law of homicide is rather strange
although there are two offences murder and manslaughter the latter includes two distinct varieties voluntary manslaughter killings which would be murder but for the existence of defined extenuating circumstances and involuntary manslaughter killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability
the arguments therefore tend to focus on three borderline questions what is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder
what conditions are needed to reduce murder to manslaughter
and what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter
c requirements for murder
in english criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder an intent to kill or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
what do these requirements mean
do they extend the definition of murder too far or are they too narrow 
intent to kill may be regarded as the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder but to some extent that depends on the meaning of intent
this has been the subject of a number of houseof lords decisions and yet the definition is still not clear and settled 
probably the most accurate statement would be that a person to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill bythe act or omission charged or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission
in this way both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded as part of the definition of intent although there are other statements suggesting that foresight of practical or virtual certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred
how would this test be applied 
in many cases the word intent is used without elaboration but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary
a fairly typical set of facts is provided by # where d had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to burn her out
one night he went to her house poured paraffin through the letter-box and on to the front door and set it alight
one of the woman's children died in the ensuing fire
when asked why he did it d replied just to wake her up and frighten her
a defence of this kind a claim that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm requires the full definition to be put to the jury
the question is granted that d's purpose was to frighten did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone
the jury should answer this bydrawing inferences from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding circumstances
what about the alternative element in the definition an intent to cause grievous bodily harm
this has considerable practical importance since this is all that the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder
it must be shown that the defendant intended which again includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty to cause really serious injury to someone
the houseof lords confirmed this rule in # d struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair causing injuries from which the victim died a week later
d maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill but there was evidence from which the jury could infer and did infer that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm
the houseof lords upheld d's conviction for murder an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder without any proof that the defendant intended or even contemplated the possibility that death would result
does the grievous bodily harm rule extend the definition of murder too far 
if the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction it can be argued that the grievous bodily harm rule draws the line too low 
in terms of principle the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence see chapter #a namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime
byallowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction the law is violating a general principle turning the most serious of its offences into a constructive crime
why should it be necessary to construct a murder conviction out of this lesser intent
there are arguments in favour of this death is final murder is the gravest crime and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets out to kill
no one can predict whether a serious injury will result in death that may depend on the victim's physique on the speed of an ambulance on the distance from the hospital and on a range of other medical and individual matters
if one person chooses to cause serious injury to another it should be presumed that he or she realizesthat there is always a risk of death and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life as to warrant the label murder if death results
the counter-arguments which would uphold the principle of correspondence are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies beneath murder and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim's life at risk
in the leading case of lord edmund-davies dissenting gave the example of breaking someone's arm that is a really serious injury but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim's life
so in practice the grievous bodily harm rule goes further than the arguments of its protagonists would support 
would it be right then to confine the fault element in murder to an intent to kill
that would have the merit of simplicity but would it strike the right note socially
there are powerful arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill cannot be established and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings
of course one cannot be adamant about whether they merit the label murder because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter which is not susceptible of any precise resolution
it is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows it is a question of social judgment
let us briefly consider some of the possibilities
the fault element for many serious offences is intent or recklessness why should this not suffice for murder
the question is whether all killings in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious to warrant the term murder
one answer sometimes given is that they are not because a driver who overtakes on a bend knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue
this example assumes that a sympathy for motorists with overwhelm any tendency to logical analysis
one might ask whether motorists are ever justified in knowingly taking risks with other people's lives
yet if the example is modified a little so that the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled in the same way as intentional killings
this is not to suggest that motorists should be treateddifferently
the point is rather that even though knowingly taking risks with other people's lives is usually unjustifiable taking a slight risk is less serious than intentionally causing death
in discussing the boundaries of murder we are concerned with classification not exculpation
to classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad but the point remains that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings
can a satisfactory line be drawn here 
one approach would be to draw the line by reference to the degree of probability
murder is committed in those situations where d caused death byan act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result
a version of this test of foresight of high probability is usedin several other european countries it was introduced into english law bythe decision in 
# but abandoned in # on grounds of uncertainty
a second approach is to frame the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant's conduct
section # of the model penal code includes within murder those reckless killings which manifest extreme indifference to the value of human life
scots law treats as murder killings with wicked recklessness a phrase which directs the court's attention to the circumstances of the killing
both the model penal code test and the scots test may be reduced to circularity however for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be the only possible answer is wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction
admittedly the model penal code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that scots law does not but the essence of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings
their protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate labelling by the courts opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors such as distaste for the defendant's background allegiance or other activities
a third more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the criminal law revision committee in # namely that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death
neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on its own but together they restrict one another producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and marks out some heinous but non-intended killings
a fourth approach adopted by english law until # and still in force in many american jurisdictions is some form of felony-murder rule anyone who kills during the course of a felony or more restrictively a serious crime of violence or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder
thus stated there is no reference to the defendant's intention or awareness of the risks the fact that d has chosen to commit rape robbery or another serious offence and has caused death thereby is held to constitute sufficient moral grounds for placing the killing in the highest category
plainly this is a form of constructive criminal liability the murder conviction is constructed out of the ingredients of a lesser offence
presumably the justification is that d has already crossed a high moral social threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequences ensue however unforeseeable they may be
the objections would be reduced if awareness of the risk of death was also required in other words if the test were the commission of a serious offence of violence plus recklessness as to death
the effect of that test would be to pickoutthose reckless killings which occurred when d had already manifested substantial moral and legal culpability and to classify them as murder
four alternative approaches have been described and many others could be listed
the point is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not of themselves appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killings which are the most heinous
the law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killings
many people might think that a person who causes death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosives ought to be convicted of murder because there is generally speaking no excuse for using such dangerous equipment
some of the people thus covered would be armed robbers others would be terrorists
the armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim and that it went off accidentally if the jury believes that should he be convicted of murder

francesca simon describes some of the pitfalls and how to avoid them
by francesca simon
debbie adams had to let her east end terrace house in london in a hurry when her husband was re-located to ireland with two months' notice
she went to a local letting agency landlords of # roman road bethnal green london e# who found a tenant that day
she also employed landlords to manage the let
as is common practice landlords kept the tenant's deposit of # and told debbie they would take their entire fee of # up front so she expected no rent for the first month
but july also passed without debbie receiving any money
i phoned and said where's the money and was told there were problems with the book-keeper who would be coming in to sort it out says debbie
but nothing happened and i never heard from them
she repeatedly phoned landlords but was either unable to get an answer or told that manager howard keizner was unavailable 
finally after the third month passed with no rent received debbie phoned the tenants asked them to pay her directly and sent landlords a recorded-delivery letter which was returned and finally one by ordinary post stating that landlords were no longer employed as the managing agents
because they hadn't done any management debbie felt landlords were entitled only to the # per cent tenant-finding fee and therefore owed her # # months' rent plus the deposit 
in december # she sued
landlords didn't acknowledge the writ so in january debbie's solicitor requested a judgment in default for the full amount plus interest and court fees a total of #
just before the court was due to hear the request her solicitor received a cheque for #
they hadn't paid the interest and court fees but we got back every single penny they owed
we were lucky says debbie adams
howard keizner of landlords said there were a lot of complications with this particular letting and management
but he declined further comment
last week he promised to supply us with a written explanation of the way his company had treated debbie but it never arrived 
yusuf and shabira gulamali were less fortunate
they lost over # dealing with two letting agencies which closed down without paying them the rent and tenants' deposit owed on their wembley flat
they hired the first agent digs of oxford street to manage as well as to let their flat
the gulamalis received their rent for the first three months then nothing for four months and were told the computer was broken the accounts were being moved the cheque was in the post and so on
after four months they closed down owing us # says shabira
together with some other clients we took the owner to court but he escaped to spain
the second time round they dealt with r and b lettings in london nw# who they instructed just to find a tenant
the gulamalis never received the agreement form the tenants' deposit or the first month's rent
finally we went to the office and they gave us a cheque which bounced 
the offices of r and b lettings are now up for sale
anyone can set up a letting agency says david galsworthy vice president of the national association of estate agents
they come and go so it pays to deal with a member of a professional body such as the naea the royal institute of chartered surveyors or the incorporated society of valuers and auctioneers
in case of a dispute you can complain to the professional body and members are bonded which means that deposits and rent are covered in case of fraud or dishonesty
if you are thinking of letting your property the following points will help to safeguard your interests
ask any agency you are considering using if they are a member of one of the above professional associations
if in doubt ask to see proof of their membership
if in addition to finding a tenant the agency is managing the let you should be paid every month less a tenant-finding fee of between two and four weeks' rent
the agency will keep the tenant's deposit until the tenant leaves
if the letting agent is not managing the flat the tenant's deposit should be given to the owner immediately 
expect to pay a management fee of up to # per cent
some agencies deduct it every month others want it all up front so shop around
if the owner is abroad the agent will also collect tax at the standard rate of # per cent which will be deducted from your monthly rent cheque
letting agencies should never charge tenants a finder's fee although according to galsworthy many agencies do 
it's not ethical as they are acting for the landlord he says
the self-regulating naea has # members of which # also do letting and management
but galsworthy believes there is a clear need for the licensing of all letting agents
we want everyone to be licensed but the government didn't think it necessary
section # of the # estate agents act dealing with bonding licensing and standards of competency has not been brought in 
but we must have a common code and we must have licensing he said
until then owners and tenants beware
travel copse and robbers christopher somerville sees how woodland has usurped the ancient cattle thieves of the cheviot hills
by christopher somerville
when a charlton chief sat down to dinner in times gone by and found a spur on the table where his meal should have been he knew the cupboard was bare once more
his wife was telling him to saddle up and steal a fresh batch of cattle from his neighbour's herds
the families of north tynedale in westernmost northumberland charltons and robsons milburns and dodds were never slow to lay hands on each other's property in the lawless old days
here where the scottish border ran across the cheviot hills far from civilisation reiving or cattle-thieving was a way of life
remoteness is still the keynote of this region but a charlton reiving party would be hard put to it these days to work up a good gallop along the upper reaches of the north tyne river
since # the western fringes of the cheviots have been planted with # square miles of close-packed conifers whilein their depths sprawl the seven miles of the kielder water reservoir europe's largest man-made lake
i found it hard to picture what kind of landscape those statistics might have shaped until i opened the ordnance survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centre
kielder water is beautiful and the kielder trees formidably impressive in their domination of the hills
but by the time i had turned off the road from bellingham at kielder village and driven up the bumpy forest drive to east kielder farm i was longing for the sight of something other than water and trees
relief was at hand 
the farm stands on a spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forest and within # minutes i had turned my back on the corduroy battalions of trees and was striding under a still cloudy sky over tussocks of rush and coarse grass with my face to the long bare shoulders of open hillside that flank the winding shallows of the east kielder burn
the footpath that runs with the burn is not one of those carefully waymarked and leafleted by the forestry commission
there are few attractions for the kielder tourist here
the burn threads a wild and inhospitable crevice of the hills where the wind blows cold and the sense of isolation grows with each lonely mile
walking here you leave the #th century behind on the outskirts of the forest and enter the reconstructed emptiness in which the reivers and cross-border raiders of the past could operate unhindered
i squelched across tiny burns running in black channels of peat and stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roofs of scaup farm
the hollow barking of a dog came from one of the stone sheds but there was no sign of life around the buildings
scaup must be just about the loneliest farm in england tucked down in the shelter of the hills with kielder forest's dark mass blocking its southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn filling half the sky to the north
the east kielder burn divides here into scaup burn and white kielder burn
i dropped down the hill to ford white kielder upstream of the ruined farmstead of kielder head where a line of stunted alders shaggy with lichen leaned over their leafless reflections in the peat-brown water
spring comes late to this windbitten and rain-soaked valley
but there were new-born lambs in the sheep pens of scaup and a cheery hello now from the farmer and his wife tending them
those were the last human voices i heard all day
no-one lives up here in the cleft of the white kielder burn
the rough land is altogether too harsh and unyielding giving sustenance only to sheep and to the conifers high on the flanks of east kielder moor and grey mares knowe immense sweeps of hillside to right and left of the valley
the footpath on the left bank of the burn was little better than a sheep track but there were clues to its former importance as a droving road over the hills to byrness in redesdale
large boulders stood out beside the path as grey blobs in the featureless sheets of pale grass and flat stones had been placed bridges across the burns their backs hollowed by the tread of feet through the centuries
following these now disregarded signs of past activity along the old path i traversed the hillside and came down to a crumbling stone sheepfold with the roofless remains of a shepherd's hut built into one wall
the tiny single room was jammed with the mossy timbers of disused sheep pens but the little iron fire grate that once warmed the hardy men who worked here was still set in the foot of the hut's tottering gable end and the massive stone lintel had not yet fallen from its place above the doorway
a dipper flew up from the burn as i emerged from the hut his white breast flashing as he darted downstream
somewhere ahead in the crags of kielderhead moor a hawk was whistling a piercing sound in the lonely valley overlain for a few heart-stopping moments by the snarl of a jet
that jarring manifestation of furious technology seemed remote and ridiculous a dream as silence settled down on kielderhead and the hawk's whistle came down from the moors
the valley of the white kielder burn steepened again as i trudged north its curves tightening 
now the path ran through heather high above the burn past circular sheepfolds long disused and over the stony beds of side streams where the grass hung smooth and inviting concealing ankle-breaking drops
a mile above the shepherd's hut the hillsides ceased their upward rolling and curved together to form a dead-end valley of broad breasted slopes five miles from the nearest tarmac road hidden deep in the folds of the moors
the old drover's road turned aside here and climbed under the rock faces of white crags to continue its lonely course over girdle fell and down into redesdale
i could have gone with it giving myself four blissful miles of upland walking followed by as many miserable hours of fruitless searching for return transport to east kielder farm
instead i lay back in the heather and savoured the trickle of the burn and the crisp smell of peat-laden ground
not a sign of spring had yet penetrated this secret valley but another month would put that right
there were five miles of return tramping to face but they too could wait awhile 
travel a pilgrimage sans progress elisabeth de stroumillo potters round poitou
by elisabeth de stroumillo
people tend to look vague when you mention poitou
umm not a part of france we know where exactly is it
inland of la rochelle you say north of cognac and east of limoges
you sort of pass it without realising going to the dordogne
ah yes cognac
nice is it
well better than that and one of the best things about it is the fact that so few people except the french themselves bother with it
even for france the variety to be found is enormous 
my passion is for its numerous romanesque churches in most cases humbly proportioned but elevated into unique works of art by the richness of their exquisitely-sculpted decoration to go to poitou saintonge and not look at any of its churches would be going to anafrican game reserve and ignoring the animals 
for serious drinkers there is the production of cognac to investigate around cognac plus the chance to sample pineau the powerful local aperitif made from young wine laced with cognac
to the north where poitou borders on the vendee shapely clumps of trees are almost the only punctuation marks on widespreading marshy landscapes to the south it bubbles with little rolling hills
water is everywhere canals streams small busy rivers with charming names like the boutonne the mignon and the belle and big lazy rivers like the sevre niortaise and the charente
the lower reaches of the sevre niortaise are swollen with the waters that once covered the whole area until medieval monks started to dig a spider-web of ditches to drain it
now the marais poitevin is a pleasantly low profile tourist attraction where you can take canal-boat trips from villages that have hardly changed in the #-odd years i've known them maillezais with a huge and rather dull ruined abbey and coulon where i first ate the delicious local version of moules marinieres called mouclade
drifting between grassy polders to which farmers have to ferry their cattle in punts or following leafy twisting lanes marked only by rusty signs proclaiming the venise verte you're in an all-green mysteriously silent world only the occasional fisherman twitching his rod above the algae-smothered waters disturbs the stillness
there is more greenery further south in the deep forest of chize with the fine renaissance chateau of dampierre-sur-boutonne at its edge and more marshes tothe west around rochefort and marennes where those mussels and oysters are raised 
one of the region's strangesttownlets sits on those marshes brouage
somnolent now within its low grey walls and stumpy towers it was once rich on salt and powerful to boot
it had a son to be proud of samuel champlain founder of quebec who was born there around #
a century later it had an adoptive daughter to weep for #-year-old marie mancini niece of louis xiv's minister mazarin
she went there when her romance with the young king was quashed for political reasons
months later when marie had departed louis is said to have paused nostalgically at brouage on his way to paris after marrying the spanish infanta at st jean-de-luz
as you come back from brouage towards st jean-d'angely on the d# via the canalside village of pont-l'abbe-d'arnoult with a lovely romanesque church faade a sign at the junction of the d# points you to the chateau whose improbably perfect lake and gardens stare at you from posters throughout the region la roche courbon
its most surprising room covered from ceiling to floor in #th-century paintings should be a salon or library instead a dotty stone bathtub was set into one wall at a later date by a lady called charlotte
she never used it having got some of the plumbing details wrong
wriggling across country on the d# to port-d'envaux you come to two more chateaux #th-century panloy flakingromantically away on its hillock overlooking a bend in the charente and almost next door the much older moated crazannes half-smothered in amazing flamboyant gothic carving
crossing the autoroute and turning north on the d# brings you to st jean-d'angely by way of the isolated church of fenioux
its conically-roofed tower hugged about by a brood of smaller roofs candle snuffers is visible for miles
st jean-d'angely is a charming little town there are good shops as well as half-timbered houses along its narrow old streets one spanned by an ancient bell-tower
there's also a renaissance fountain and an extremely odd conglomeration of church buildings comprising one ancient ruin one proper church and the skeleton faade and nave of a rather pompous and unfinished #th-century abbey
it makes a conveniently central hub the marais poitevin village of coulon is # miles to the north by the d# which inexplicably changes its number at the top of a hill to d#
niort is about the same distance by the parallel n#
saintes with gallo-roman remains a beautiful romanesque abbey and an atmospheric medieval quarter is # miles south of st jean #-odd miles to the north-west is surgeres all of whose public buildings including an engagingly asymmetrical church are within the #th-century castle walls scattered among beautiful gardens and parkland perfect for picnicking
just under # miles south-west of st jean on the brouage road st-savinien is at the upper limit of the tidal reaches of the charente
the villagers' main hobby seems to be fishing with peculiar saucer nets suspended from precariously-perched bankside huts
one fisherman waxed lyrical about the variety of fish in the river
even salmon he assured me but of course those are protected and must be thrown back 
which they are normalement
like almost every other poitevin town and village st-savinien has a sweet romanesque church melle indeed has three
but aulnay just over # miles north-east of st jean is probably the best its unassuming architecture a perfect frame for the sheer artistry of the carvings round its doors and windows
biblicalmotifs recur some art-experts themsermons in stone and their messages would certainly have been clear to the often-illiterate medieval pilgrims trudging to santiago de compostela in spain
but these themes are always interspersedwith more fanciful ones grimacing masks weird animals exuberant abstract patterns
i think those #thand #th-century sculptors were motivated not just by piety but also by a certain competitive spirit if a church was finer than the one in the next village more pilgrims would surely pause there
today's attraction-merchants are doing to lure #th-century tourists their medieval forebears did for pilgrims 
way of the world farming notes
by auberon waugh
many will take it as a further surrender to common market bureaucracy that an inspectorate will soon be established to regulate the smell of farm manure
in fact with the development of deep-litter hen houses and intensive pig culture some such controls are necessary
the smell released by a pig or chicken farm is indescribable and can affect # square miles of countryside around
one may doubt whether modern farming has any useful purpose nowadays when everybody is on a diet
it mostly seems to involve producing food for animals to eat whose excrement is then collected to assist the growth of more food for animals
small children can sometimes be persuaded to eat cow cake in the same way that old people will eat cat food but the chief result of all this farming was to produce huge food mountains which we could then refuse to give to the third world or to the socialists of eastern europe in order to teach them the error of their ways 
however there is a new plan to turn land over to wind farming
it involves nothing more than putting up #-foot masts all over the land
a #-acre grouse moor will generate enough electricity in this way to power a town of # people
the farmer receives a rent of # a year and is relieved of the need to do any work for it
all the food we need will be provided by monster underground funguses producing a regular crop of mushrooms without human assistance
the masts may seem unsightly to those unused to them but i am sure it is simplya matter of getting accustomed
cows were thought very unsightly when they were first introduced 
nowadays we all swoon with pleasure at the sight of a cow

duvets phonecards hot showers and video films will greet inmates atbritain's first privately-run prison when it opens on monday
the wolds a remand centre at brough north humberside is far removed from the insanitary conditions which prevail at many jails
the # inmates will be allowed out of their cells for # hours a day with a minimum of six hours education and # hours exercise a week
the # million remand prison has # single and # shared cells each with its own lavatory and washbasin
recreation areas have telephones and pool tables
nail clippers combs toothpaste and toothbrushes razors and washbags are neatly laid out on tables in the cells to await the arrival of inmates many of whom will not be carrying such items because they may not have expectedto be remanded in custody
the cells are luxurious compared to some of the things we put up with in the army said one staff member during a press tour of the jail
the prison has a medical block with # beds and a gym with equipment that staff said would be the envy of many council leisure centres
group # remand services ltd the security firm selected by the home office to manage the wolds in a # million-a-year contract likes to think of its prisoners customers
it may seem a little odd for prison staff to be looking at their prisoners customers but they are the direct consumers of our service explained mr stephen twinn prison director who spent # years in the public sector at various gradesof prison governor
the # male warders or custody officers as they are called wear a dapper outfit of black blazers grey trousers white shirts and grey tie
women managers have a choice as to whether they wear trousers or a skirt

election # and what can the politicians do for meadowell
probably nothing at all
joyriding riots propelled tyneside's meadowell estate to national prominence last september
has the election campaign penetrated its grim streets
by martyn harris
at the drop-in centre on south meadowell labour candidate paddy cosgrove has dropped in to meet the people mostly fat ladies in shellsuits with laps full of chips
you all know me says paddy and a fat lady with good timing says i don't know you
never seen you in me life
on the floor a toddler peels more chips from a congealed bluish mass and feeds them to a baby
another digs the cream from the centre of a pink fancy and smears it in his hair
paddy cosgrove councillor and barrister in candidates' pinstripes sits tensely on the edge of his plastic chair
i'm a regular visitor to this estate
who does he say he is says a second fat lady
that liberal paddy ashgrove
he's better looking on tv
he's only come because the press are here says the first fat lady
and paddy cosgrove blushes
political consciousness is low on the meadowell estate
turnout at the last election was around # per cent and with the thinning of the electoral roll brought by the poll tax will be even lower this time
they are mostly labour voters but several confuse their labour candidate with the leader of the liberal democrats
very few know their mp is a conservative and hardly anyone that his name is neville trotter defender of a slender # majority
by most measures meadowell is the worst council estate in britain and probably the most notorious since the riots last september which followed the deaths of joyriders colin atkins and dale robson in a police chase
in fact meadowell is an elastoplast name like sizewell invented in the # to disguise what was already a running sore 
when built in # it was the ridges which is still what they call it locally a slum clearance project on the north bank of the tyne # miles east of newcastle
its first inhabitants were shipyard and fishquay workers from the riverside towns of north shields and wallsend who moved happily from their tumbledown terraces to these fine new houses with inside toilets and gardens
many like ronnie collyer a retired shipyard worker still live here and are still proud of the place
all the trouble says ronnie is down to a few families who doan't keep their young uns in order 
and then the media coom down and blow everything up 
he has polished shoes a close shave and too much pride for a free drink
it's a canny place the ridges with plenty of good folk
but something was wrong from the start 
some say it was the importing of whole streets of fighting families from the fishquays with their dockland diversions of prostitution drug-dealing and handling 
others say it was the shortage of pubs shops churches transport and police stations
by the # the ridges was the criminal ghetto of newcastle and by the # a costly council manicure job had turned it into a free-fire zone
paths and boundaries vanished allowing the tides of street life to wash right up to the doorsteps
joyriders used front lawns to practise their handbrake turns
car theft became so common that private cars virtually disappeared from the area
shops like greengrocers and chippies with pitiful cash takings were routinely subjected to armed robberies with shotguns balaclavas the whole bit 
when i ask the fat ladies atthe drop-in centre what is the one thing that would do most to improve the estate they say get rid of the kids and they are only half joking
the age structure of meadowell means it is awash withteenagers whose only pastimes are having babies and body-building
do your husbands come here
i ask and they all laugh
the men are all useless sitting indoors if there's trouble in the street
it's women have to go out and deal with it
by the time of the riots a quarter of all houses on the estate were boarded up and burned out by infant petrol bombers
unemployment was # per cent on some streets
in meadowell primary which has # children every one was receiving a clothing grant
the area had effectively been abandoned by the authorities a fact which became clear during the riot itself when police waited five hours to enter the estate and put down the disturbances
and there were never more than a few dozen ringleaders bob mather a local butcher tells me
i was stood outside me shop all night and most were no more than kids
eight months on and little has changed if anything it is rather worse
unemployment is up another # per cent more houses and shops are boarded up burglaries and joyriding continue and if there is less ram-raiding it is only because # or so of the hardest cases are still behind bars 
a food co-op which tried to replace the burned-out shops has been closed after several break-ins and even the drop-in centre is burgled weekly according to project worker sheila auld
there is a new phone box ripped from the wall and lying on the floor of her office to prove it
meadowell has even discovered a new martyr in the shape of one willy hunter a local hard nut awaiting trial for murder and allegedly the victim of a police frame-up
free willy hunter say the graffiti next to the old fading graffiti for dale robson and colin atkins
my friend kevin muscleman and minicab driver says the lads would be out rioting for willy now if it wasn't tipping down with rain the whole time
a few things have been achieved i suppose
there are some posh flats going up atneighbouring royal quays which will provide building jobs it's sun city in the middleof bantustan a labour councillor said to me
the cheviot housing association is slowly taking over property in south meadowell
a new police station is to be built
the government sponsored meadowell initiative makes noises in the north of the estate but does pitifully little painfully slowly 
north tyneside council says it is too starved of funds by central government to do much
tory ministers like michael heseltine who visited meadowell last november say the cash shortages are due to council profligacy and bad management
mp neville trotter is a pear-shaped tory with pear-shaped vowels who has little appeal to the people of meadowell and a dwindling appeal in the middle-class suburbs where unemployment is also climbing 
paddy cosgrove his likely replacement is a council hack of # years standing and ideal backbench fodder though it is hard to imagine him leading a crusade for meadowell
when i ask the people of the estate what they want from this election some say they want cheviot to rebuild it and others that it would be better grassed over
some say they should bring back hanging others say it is the politicians they should hang but most say there is nothing anybody can do at all

con maj #
sit they said but he wouldn't this week john major began to appear on a different kind of box 
in the last of his series on the leaders frank johnson reports
by frank johnson
we were in the west country
the prime minister was on his soapbox 
just up the road at langport in somerset was the birthplace of walter bagehot #�# although as he directed his microphone atliberal democrat hecklers john major had other things on his mind
the relevance is that bagehot was the first political commentator
the travelling chaos of a modern party leader's election entourage had carried major within a few miles of the home of the founder of the profession a few of whose more troublesome contemporary practitioners are said to have caused him much irritation over the # months of his premiership
a liberal
he's admitted to being a liberal
major cried jabbing a finger in the direction of one heckler
the man had a liberal democrat rosette pinned to his cap
he was also carrying an orange poster on a pole urging a vote for the local liberal democrat candidate
therefore the admission which the prime minister wrung from him could hardly be said to have been grudging
but like all the best soapbox orators major had prepared his repartee in advance 
i knew there was one here he continued meaning liberal democrats
there were in fact about a score 
then came the passage which appeared on the television news that evening and in the papers the next day about the liberal democrats being the trojan horse that would let labour in 
there were also some lines intended for local consumption higher petrol prices from the liberal democrats that's not gonna help a rural area
 what would bagehot have made of him
like the heckler he was a liberal
there the similarity ends since judging from his writings bagehot was a roaring snob whereas judging from his heckles the heckler was not
more to the point it was bagehot who said a constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilities
the statesman to whom he was referring was peel
a political commentator of our own day paul johnson quoted it not long after major became prime minister to suggest that it was also true of him
but is it still
b agehot's phrase comes in a passage in which he appears to propound the dispiriting theory that a politician if he wants to get anywhere must appeal to the average man
the average man is a cool common person with a considerate air with figures in his mind with his own businessto attend to with a set of ordinary opinions arising from and suited to ordinary life
he can't bear novelty or originalities
original theories give trouble
bagehot goes on to say of peel from a certain peculiarity of intellect and fortune he was never in advance of his time
of almost all the great measures with which his name is associated he attained great eminence as an opponent before he attained even greater eminence as their advocate 
that last sentence has more to do with kinnock than with major
it is also a warning to all hack tories who think that it is a telling blow against kinnock to keep on pointing out that he has reversed his opinions about unilateral nuclear disarmament british membership of the ec or anything else
but the most striking thing about bagehot's essay on peel in the light of the last full week of this election campaign is that it simply does not apply to major at all
common opinions were what got major into difficulties in the first place 
between his becoming prime minister and his party's fall in the polls about # days ago major did nearly everthing that common opinion wanted him to do
this was true of what he did about both high policy and low politics
for example on high policy common opinion said that there was nothing for it but to stay in the erm
he stayed in and the recession worsened
in low politics common opinion no less common for being expensively hired by conservative central office encouraged him in the belief that he should fight much of the election sitting down
he did so and he looked like the questioner in the studio audience rather than the answerer
the result was wobbly week the second week of the campaign 
but last saturday major climbed on to that soapbox in luton
until then he had been that most inhuman of creatures the public figure described by others as very human
now he really was human unscripted jokey even a bit passionate
the jubilant word from kinnock's camp was that major was behaving more like an opposition leader than a prime minister
but there seemed nothing wrong with the head of government appearing to be the challenger on the hustings
president truman did so in a campaign which no-one expected him to win and he won
it is justified if the head of government is challenging something powerful 
kinnock complains of the alleged power of the tory tabloid press but he has powers on his side too
ninety per cent of his party's cash comes from the unions which will expect a return 
the british people have in the past found them rather more powerful than the corporations which are popularly supposed to finance the conservative party
then there are all those schoolteachers dons television producers writers on arts pages and members of the agitatingclasses who want a labour win in order to impose political correctness
that is to say they will have what the jesuits once attached such importance to power over young or impressionable minds
as the week went by major rejected common opinion about two other large subjects proportional representation and scottish devolution
he hardened his opposition to both despite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the first and vocal forces within his scottish party were in support of the second
e ven at this late hour psephology demographics and luck suggest that the tories could still emerge as the biggest single party in a hung parliament
is it possible that major would rather go into opposition with the dangers that would mean for his continued leadership of the conservative party than offer pr and scottish devolution to the liberal democrats
if so we are dealing with a more quixotic romantic or principled figure than some of us used to think
once that soapbox came out major campaigned as if he would now do and say what he really thought
was it too late
from central office and from around his entourage came the unmistakable signs of fair weather friendspreparing to detach themselves from blame for defeat
and then on thursday morning when major's election tour reached the daily mail ideal home exhibition sir david english the paper's editor was not there to greet him
a junior spin doctor is reported to have muttered though admittedly out of my earshot we've been snubbed
not sir david
some in the profession of political commentating would opt for bagehot as their formative influence but mine has long been sir david a founder of biased tory journalism
his lack of humbug about political balance has always made him more honest than all the employees of bbc current affairs awaiting with glee the kinnock years
eventually sir david's office issued a statement about the prime minister
normally a prime minister's office would issue a statement about an editor
but major makes a point of not being grand and with sir david it is the other way about 
sir david english was not informed of the visit and in consequence had no plans to attend the ideal home exhibition that day the official statement announced 
faith in sir david's leadership was restored 
scientists click over a way to save dolphins
by greg neale environment correspondent
hundreds of thousands of dolphins could be saved from death thanks to pioneering work by british scientists
they believe they have found a cheap practical means of preventing dolphins entangling themselves in monofilament drift fishing nets the walls of death believed to be responsible for killing large numbers of dolphins off cornwall this year
but their work is hampered by lack of money
so far they have received nothing from the government little ec assistance and are running out funds donated by individuals and industry
the researchers headed by dr margaret klinowska a cambridge biologist and david goodson an expert on acoustic engineering at loughborough university say new data shows that plastic sound reflectors to fishing nets can warn dolphins of hazards
data to be published shortly draws on experiments including observations of freddy the dolphin that has been living off the northumbrian coast for four years
using equipment donated by racal the scientists have analysed recordings of the clicking dolphins make while hunting
observations of freddy led them to conclude that dolphins use sonar while hunting
they emit an intense broad-band click or pulse of sound
echoes of the signal alert them to possible prey at ranges up to #�# metres in shallow waters
mr goodson who became interested in the sonar capacity of dolphins after hearing one while swimming off the welsh coast has experimented with various shapes of sound reflectors 
the most promising is eliptical about #�in long
the theory is that its internal air pocket will bounce back the dolphin's sonar signal regardless of the direction of approach
last autumn dr klinowska mr goodson and their team put the theories into practice
in the moray firth they placed a headline barrier from which they had suspended reflectors at two-metre intervals
the movement of dolphins around the barrier was observed using electronic equipment to monitor sonar activity 
the results exceeded our expectations said mr goodson
dolphins swimming near the barrier altered their behaviour to avoid it the result the scientists believe of them detecting sonar echoes from the reflectors 
dr klinowska said that although it was necessary to be cautious about the findings a combination of reflector devices and some modification of fishing gear might reduce deaths
but the moray firth experiments were only possible after the naturalist dr david bellamy helped secure a donation from the co-operative wholesale society
our work is being delayed simply through the lack of funding said dr klinowska
the scientists hope to raise # through an appeal by windsor safari park
donations can be made to the dolphin research project c o windsor safari park windsor berkshire sl# #ay

the st petersburg national opera the national chaliapin's company is in new york for the first time
the management of the kirov that other opera house in st petersburg are furious 
the core of the problem is simple the national was invited to new york only last november and the kirov is planning to tour this summer
both are presenting the great russian warhorses boris godunov and the queen of spades
both companies expected to bring the bass vladimir ognovenko to sing boris and the mezzo-soprano irina bogatcheva
russian singers don't spend their lives with one company any more
but kirov's management satra arts international felt badly upstaged
under pressure from satra kirov told singers to choose between the companies
the national's boris godunov was built around ognovenko he had to stay home 
the mezzo irina bogatcheva wife of the national's artistic director stanislav gaudassinksy agreed to limit her roles
but that wasn't enough
for daring to come at all she was cut from the kirov team 
she went home in tears at the weekend
but her husband did have consolation on saturday as we talked over scotch and peking duck the sound of american cheers for his robust version of boris godunov

the arts in the name of charity
by lewis jones
charity is a divine attribute but we are enjoined to give forgetfully lest we fall into the absurd error of mistaking ourselves for gods
the perils of ignoring this advice were well illustrated by angel of bengal c# the true stories documentary by anna raphael which was by turns hilarious and enraging
the angel in question was an american woman who calls herself rytasha
apart from a particularly vicious nose-job and alarming turquoise-coloured contact lenses rytasha is rather beautiful and in the # when she went by the name of ricki she was a successful model she began life as maxine shenkman
an earlier film by raphael the persuaders # charted the transformation of ricki into rytasha which occurred at the hare krishna temple in london and her uneasy relationship with her guru there
it would have been interesting to have seen the two films together 
since # rytasha has broken away from her guru and set up on her own with a charity called food relief international which raises money from the fiercelycompetitive matrons of palm beach and distributes it to the starving people of bangladesh
she adaws bangladesh gushed rytasha's mother the fiercest matron of them all rejoicing in the improbable title of baroness thea von theilheimer shenkman
she went on to list her daughter's achievements she put in an irritation system
 with no trace of a smile or a blush the baroness quickly corrected herself an irrigation system but the slip was a telling one and i'm sure they would have appreciated it in bangladesh
the villagers of ramsala recipients of the palm beach dollars explained to the cameras that they desperately needed a clinic
we told her that a mud hut would do but she said no she'd build something pukka
a pukka building was duly erected but its medical function has somehow been indefinitely postponed
it is devoted instead to the worship of the charitable rytasha who is not content simply to hand over the cash but insists in an unfortunate hangover from her hare krishna days on posturing as a spiritual master
the villagers seemed unimpressed but were given no choice in the matter
nor could the vaunted irrigation scheme be described as an unqualified success
the money ran out before the scheme's completion and the villagers found themselves obliged to borrow the rest
they begged rytasha for reimbursement but none was forthcoming and for the want of a few hundred pounds the village lost its crop for the year
now what are we supposed to do asked one of them
are we to sell our cattle or our land
the most irritating thing about rytasha and there were many was that though she does not speak their language she presumes to teach them a spurious form of their own religion
one thing we don't need in this subcontinent professor rokeya kabeer observed is spiritual guidance we have gurus a dime a dozen 
they are far too civilised for that sort of thing in bangladesh but i kept thinking wistfully of t s eliot's lines in sweeney agonistes about a nice little white little missionary stew
city comment there's spring in the step of the stock market
at least last friday's post-election stock market surge was not a one-day special offer for the professionals only
prices have remained high the ft-se index has risen another # points since then allowing even the most passive of private investors including unit trust holders to take advantage of the market 
the # pc gain since election day is looking increasingly sustainable
it is not that prospects for earnings are # pc better that they were in the middle of last week but it is possible to argue that prospects are that much better than they would have been under a labour government and that the market was discounting such a result
the ft-se failed to hold its gains yesterday but shortly after opening it was only six points away from last september's previous record closing level 
wall street has been hitting new peaks this week too which has given support to the london market and even japan's nikkei index in a typically erratic period has gained nearly # points while london added its # but london has real strengths of its own
the city view is that the fall in corporate earnings has stopped and that next year's increase could be around # pc
the market's price-earnings multiple was # last night but it would drop below # if that increase in earnings really happens
the increase will not be matched by dividend rises too many companies have been paying more than they could afford over the past two years and need to repair their reserves and ratios but # pc growth looks reasonable 
the market yield a historic #� pc could return back above # pc therefore giving basic-rate taxpayers a real return with the prospect of real growth too
not all problems have gone away of course yesterday's # billion public sector borrowing requirement is not much higher than expectations but it is almost as large as the deficit for the previous # months and with this year's deficit forecast to be double last year's shows why the bank of england so eagerly sold # billion or more of gilts on election night and why it needs a regular stream of massive sales
the change in employment may not always be so favourable as yesterday's either but the market is now starting to feel bullish and looking for a ft-se of # by next year
city lloyd's members fail in bid to protect cash fund
by karen cooper
more than # lloyd's of london members on syndicates managed by the loss-making gooda walker agency have failed in their legal attempt to prevent lloyd's and members' agents from drawing down their funds
michael freeman the solicitor who advised the members on court action said yesterday this will cause the most dreadful hardship
there is going to be a great deal of pain in the market place now
in an earlier than expected commercial court judgment mr justice saville found that the members had not produced enough evidence of irregularities in the lmx spiral which sends catastrophe risks swirling round the market to stop the usual process of calling on cash deposits to make good syndicate losses
however he suggested there was perhaps a need to look into the system more closely
costs were awarded to the members' agents but not to lloyd's
the members many of whom are unable to fulfil the latest #m cash call due on march # to cover #�# losses on syndicates were seeking an interim injunction to stop members' agents and lloyd's dipping into their security
they were challenging the pay now sue later principle at lloyd's which says names should pay cash calls first and fight them later
lloyd's chairman david coleridge welcomed the judgment
we have every sympathy with those who have made substantial underwriting losses in recent years but lloyd's owes its first duty to policyholders with valid claims which must be met he said
mr freeman said an appeal was most unlikely because we are not going to get any more evidence
earlier this month preliminary findings from an investigation by kenneth randall found that the gooda walker agency may have overstated its syndicates' profits between # and # through the use of time and distance policies about which it had failed to inform its auditors in at least one syndicate
peter nutting who led the association of outhwaite members to a succesful settlement said he sympathised with gooda walker names but if the names were not going to pay these calls who did they think was going to pay them 
meanwhile members who were not part of the #m outhwaite out-of-court settlement have voted to press their claims for compensation through the # outhwaite names association
it plans to issue a protective writ but is hoping to achieve a settlement 
the nhs is not for sale virginia bottomley talks to george jones in her first interview since joining the cabinet
by george jones
the new health secretary mrs virginia bottomley set herself an ambitious target yesterday to take the politics out of the national health service
but her desire to provide a period of stability for nearly one million people employed by the nhs is coupled with a fierce determination to maintain the momentum of reform with the overwhelming majority of hospitals becoming self-governing trusts by the mid-#
labour sought to turn the general election into a referendum on the nhs asking voters for a mandate to reverse the changes
mrs bottomley is convinced the tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms and to give doctors nurses and managers the confidence to make them work 
in her first full interview since being appointed health secretary she said the election result and mr major's unequivocal commitment to the nhs had finally nailed the lie about privatisation of health care
the nhs is not for profit
it is not for sale
it will continue to be true to its founding principles available to all and free at the point of delivery she said
she recalled a promise made by mr major when he became prime minister that he would work for a nation at ease with itself
i want to see a health service at ease with itself optimistic and confident about its essential work 
health is something which touches every individual and family in the country she said
but there must be changes
an organisation that doesn't change fossilises 
health needs to develop and alter 
by next year she is confident that two thirds of hospitals will have become self-governing trusts within the nhs
she pledged that the government would safeguard those that did not opt for trust status but she expected this to be a minority
the government will also encourage more family doctors to hold budgets to buy services for patients and is looking at ways to enable smaller practices to team up to secure the advantages of fund holding 
the election result has given the conservatives five years in which to press ahead with the changes
most people are likely to judge the reforms on how long they have to wait for treatment the issue behind the jennifer's ear controversy during the election campaign 
mrs bottomley stressed her commitment to the patient's charter which has already eliminated almost all waits of more than two years for nhs operations
the next step is to ensure that from march no one should have to wait more than # months for a hip or knee replacement or a cataract operation
a national standard will also be set for outpatient waiting times
mrs bottomley's first big test as health secretary will come this summer with the annual public spending round which will be conducted against a background of concern over high government borrowing and pressure from the tory right for public spending cuts 
the conservative manifesto contained a commitment to increase year by year the level of real resources committed to the nhs though it put no figure on the extra money to be allocated
mrs bottomley representing caring conservatism will face mr michael portillo the new treasury chief secretary who is equally keen to establishhis right-wing credentials by demonstrating he can keep keep a tight grip on the public purse strings
she acknowledged that there could be difficult times ahead 
it will always be the case that the holder of my office will need to fight the corner of the health service and there will always inevitably be more than we can do
but she stressed there would be no let-up in the search for greater efficiency
as well as fighting for more money her task was to ensure that every last pound was spent as effectively as it could be
her priorities include giving more encouragement to medical research emphasis on preventive health to make the nhs a health as well as a sickness service with the publication shortly of new national targets for reducing deaths from heart disease and cancers and pressing ahead with care in the community 
as a former psychiatric social worker mrs bottomley is determined to improve standards of care for mentally ill and handicapped people
it is not acceptable to have people who require a home confined to long-stay institutions when they could be in more domestic settings 
that is a real challenge she said
mrs bottomley's rise to the top has been swift with only four years between her first ministerial post and a seat at the cabinet table
but she bridles at suggestions that the inclusion of two women mrs gillian shephard at the department of employment and herself has excluded more able men from the cabinet
prime ministers always have to consider balance in the cabinet and at least we now have the same number of women as old etonians in john major's team she said 
a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice some sobering thoughts lr singer
lawrence singer is an assistant chief probation officer with merseyside probation service
beforehand he worked as a probation officer for berkshire probation service and later as a research officer for somerset probation service where he undertook the research reported here
the paradigm which is describedoriginates from doctoral research into generic probation practice and has been presented in a book # gower
summary
the government white paper proposes a radical change for probation practice
henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form of punishment
this article challenges the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context 
probation officers it is argued are concerned with establishing rules for probationers and not inflicting pain on them
an alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described
the paradigm is based on the joint supervisory aims of support and surveillance which are implemented through the methods of counselling assisting directing and monitoring
to illustrate the paradigm reference is made to an alcohol education course developed for offenders in trouble through drink
the efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated bythe results reported from a three year evaluation study covering # offenders
the article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character of current probation work and argues that to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community the probation officer's employment of established social work knowledge skills and values is a strength not a weakness 
the aim of this article is to challenge the assertion contained in the white paper home office #a that probation practice can be conceived of as a form of punishment in the community
issue will be taken with the appropriateness of applying the concept of punishment to the probation context through reference to a demanding and successful probation project concerned with offenders in trouble through drink
in describingthe project a non-punitive model for understanding probation practice will be developed
this non-punitive paradigm will provide a framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plans inappropriately to transform probation work into a new approach to punishment in the community p # para #
the punitive approach anticipated for the probation service in the white paper is underpinned bya definition of punishment that resides in the restrictions on liberty and in the enforcement of the orders 
the white paper goes on to emphasize it is the loss of liberty involved in carrying out the terms of the order rather than the activities carried out during the order which is the punishment p # para #
notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital to be derived from such a humane-sounding statement this definition is nevertheless at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment
discourses on punishment and dictionary definitions of the term clearly specify the central feature of punishment as being the infliction of pain rather than the loss of liberty hudson #
the conceptual and practical implications of this discrepancy will be examined in the third and final section of this article
beforehand however consideration will be given first to the probation project and second to its evaluation
in these sections punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment
at a time when the home secretary is inviting the probation service to move centre stage in the criminal justice system nacro # p # it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the white paper's notion of punishment
punishment is just a word after all nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only lip service from probation managers and practitioners poised at the window of opportunity
however this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice namely that language not only reflects but also shapes social reality
as davies # has pointed out speech is the basic tool of the social worker
what we say influences what we think and in turn what we do
if punishment is assimilated into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the service undertakes 
in the sections to follow the stark question is therefore put is the probation service in the business of inflicting pain and the answer which unfolds may be summarized no because it neither aspires nor wishes to 
the project more demanding than punishment
government concern about the problem of drink-related offending is as old as the probation service
indeed as bochel # has shown the establishment of a probation service in england and wales was inextricably linked with work undertaken with offenders in trouble through drink
almost a century later the new approach to punishment in the community outlined bythe white paper once again presents alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring community-based intervention
alcohol the white paper states is implicated in a wide variety of crimes drunken driving offences of public disorder and domestic violence p # para # #
in describing its vision of effective supervision the white paper goes on to note 
offenders take part in alcohol education programmes so that they can learn to drink sensibly
they learn about the relative strength of different drinks the amount which is safe to consume and the pitfalls to avoid eg competitive drinking and buying rounds p # para #
as a summary of alcohol education programmes this is something of a simplification
however it does provide a useful introduction to the origins of the alcohol education course reported here
furthermore it highlights the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice
in # the management of somerset probation service was faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offenders supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol singer #
aware of practitioners' frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic clients probation management in partnership with the voluntary sector determined to developan alcohol education course aec
by # when social inquiry report monitoring information covering # offenders indicated that the problem of drink-related offending was virtually as great for preas for post-sentence clients that is alcohol was cited as a pre-offence problem in twenty-nine per cent of cases a specialist project worker had been appointed
towards the end of # an aec was launched and has been running ever since
the aim of the course is to educate offenders about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug
this aim is underpinned bythree interrelated objectives and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the white paper's own trinity of aims of supervision that is protection of the public prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community p # para #
these were
#
to increase knowledge about alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent
#
to instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour
#
to encourage the maintenance of or where appropriate a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake
to meet these objectives the aec has a structured programme involving group and individual contact that is six group sessions sandwiched between one-to-one interviews held immediately before and after the group 
the initial one-to-one meeting held with one of the two group leaders serves to clarify what participants can expect from the course and what is expected of them
a standard contract which covers conditions of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignments between group sessions is signed by each participant
the final interview entails a personalized review of the course as well as the formulation of a follow-up plan to be undertaken with the offender's supervising officer
the course employs a variety of materials and techniques including the use of checklists magazine and newspaper clippings quizzes videos brainstorm exercises discussions drink diaries and role plays menary #
the aec is primarily intended for young adults subject to a probation order with a special condition of attendance schedule # #aii criminal justice act # and reflects the fact that most somerset offenders in trouble through drink commit serious offences and or possess a substantial number of previous convictions
in short they are seriously at risk of committing further offences and becoming trapped in the revolving door of custody
the developmentof the somerset aec both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the home office's recent guidance to sentencers
in recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources to supervising the more serious and persistent offenders
probation orders which are combined with constructive disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being usedfor offenders who stand to receive custodial sentences #b p #
from the description of the aec already given the demanding and disciplined nature of the course can be appreciated
however the course is not punitive it is not concerned with the infliction of pain 
instead it is concerned with the establishment of rules 
this is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out 
you will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout the course and make attempts at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking levels
you must be willing to be helped and help others your experiences will be useful to other group members 
you must attend # sessions these will consist of an introductory session six group sessions and a final assessment interview
you must not drink before the session
you must be on time lateness will count as an absence
unlike the prison inmate aec participants cannot sit back and passively do their time
probation practice is not however solely concerned with the establishment of rules 
as has been demonstrated elsewhere with regard to the generic probation setting singer # the supervision of offenders involves two overarching aims namely support and surveillance
support refers to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problems surveillance to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to socially acceptable standards of behaviour
these aims are implemented through the practice of four distinguishable but related methods
in terms of support there is counselling and assisting in terms of surveillance there is directing and monitoring
each of these four methods are employed during the eight sessions
although summarized as an alcohol course the sessions are not just concerned with giving information but also with enabling participants to make practical useof it
in the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor's notes menary # bythe explanation this session aims to get participants to consider the subject of alcohol in ways they had not thought of in the past p #
during this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized 
drinks exercises introduce the notion of measurement concentration of alcohol content information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the course p #
in the fifth group session entitled focus on the individual the counselling and the monitoring combine with the directing and assisting methods
at the start of the session the tutor's notes make clear that directing extends beyond enforcing the conditions of attendance
this session allows for an indepthexamination of the drinking diaries over the last five weeks identifying the risky circumstances or situations 
the aim at the end of the session is to encourage participants to make rules for their future drinking which will lead to a lessening of identified problems p #
similarly the assisting extends beyond simply providing handouts of useful information 
it is important that participants are provided with the skills to reduce their drinking levels or handle more effectively pub centred problems
the useof role play incorporating previously discussed difficulties ie homework assignment session # in real or set up situations provides an opportunity for testing these skills
probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course comes in the fifth session when somerset practitioners take the logic of working with the problem in the community to its ultimate conclusion
in the second half of the session course leaders sponsor participants to an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skills and purchasing non-alcoholic drinks
the counselling assisting directing and monitoring on the aec give substance to the aims of support and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model of probation practice
punishment has no place in this model 
instead the aec can best be understood as an example of a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice
twenty years ago the advisory council on the penal system observed that notions of punitiveness do not accord with the british concept of probation as an alternative to rather than a suspension of punishment quoted in bochel # p #
twenty years later the aec demonstrates that this remains no less true now than it was then
but does the aec work 
bringing fossils back to life 
in this chapter some of the ways in which palaeontologists determine the way fossil animals lived are described reanimating the dead fragments to build up a living creature 
since popular ideas of life in the past are often founded on vividly coloured reconstructions of the world in the jurassic period and the like it is important to remember that these imaginative scenes are all inferences from bones and similar fragments
in fact there is nothing fixed about such interpretations because the way the fossils are understood may change over the years but it is usually some time before new discoveries percolate into the popular presentations
even the most solid-looking dinosaurs may have changed their habits in the last few years
many different lines of evidence may be usedto flesh out the bare bones of the fossils
the first of these is the evidence of the rocks from which the remains were recovered
the sediments themselves reveal much about the environment of deposition as was shown in chapter #
it is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished its sedimentary cover or whether its remains were swept in from some other place
fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruders 
the type of sediment and the associated fossils will show whether the environment was marine freshwater or terrestrial providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal has to be accommodated 
the sediments themselves may have preserved some of the tracks left by the animal p # to give direct evidence of its past activities 
from the tracks alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance of certain dinosaurs and to measure their stride 
the character of the rocks and their setting in the past geography at the time when they accumulated diagnoses the climatic setting in which the extinct fauna lived and climate imposes certain restraints on possible modes of life
savannah animals differ from those of tropical rain forests and these again from inhabitants of the tundra at high latitudes
looking at the fossil animal itself the first necessity is to reconstruct it as accurately as possible from its fragmentary remains
sometimes this is a very complex business particularly for vertebrates with numbers of small bones
to proceed from the reconstruction to an assessment of probable life habits two different but complementary approaches are used 
one method attempts to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal with living 
these do not have to be biologically related organisms
the basic argument is that structures that are closely similar were probably adapted to a similar function
sometimes these similarities are quite obvious the ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habits with hardly a glance at the fangs of living mammalian carnivores
but the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammals in which opposing teeth co-operate in action and which can be matched in extinct unrelated mammals is a much more subtle matter involving detailed studies on the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones
the technique of hunt the analogue is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists but it is certainly not a foolproof one because there are many fossil animals that defy comparison with living organisms and some analogues do not stand up to detailed scrutiny
the second method tries to analyse the structure of the fossil almost it a piece of engineering 
if the fossil is constructed in a certain way then there are only a limited number of jobs that the structure could perform 
the idea here is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one
this assumes that nature only manufactures efficient designs 
for the most part this is a reasonable assumption to make 
most animals today do seem to have bodies that accord well with the functions they have to carry out to survive flyers are aerodynamically efficient active swimmers have suitable streamlining herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food and so on
ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various functions in experiments but the number of examples where the analysis has been pursued this far are limited
of course it can never be known whether the right answer has been reached unless somebody dredges up a living fossil from the depths of the ocean there are only varying degrees of probability
but the best answers are probably obtained where the functional design of the fossil points to the same life habits as a living analogue and where both are consistent with the geological circumstances in which the fossil remains occur
swimming trilobites
there are thousands of different kinds of trilobites
all of them were marine and all of them are extinct
since many kinds of trilobites co-existed at any one time they were probably occupying different ecological niches behaving in different ways corresponding with the wide variation in shape that they show 
we can usethe methods described above to elucidate some of these occupations and get a glimpse albeit an imperfect one of the trilobite as it lived
i will take an example where the methods can be used and where all point in the same direction so that the answer is probably correct
most trilobites were broadly oval-shaped being rather longer than wide not greatly convex and with eyes that occupy perhaps a quarter of the length of the head
there are a few trilobite species however with enormous globular eyes see below 
byexamining the way these animals were put together it is possible to suggest a likely mode of life 
giant-eyed ordovician trilobite seen from the top and side
twice its natural size
enlargement shows a section through the lenses to show the direction of the field of view
we can take the eyes first
the trilobite eye was of a compound type and each lens was made up of a calcite crystal
from the optical properties of this mineral we know that the lens was able to interpret light coming from a direction more or less at right-angles to the lens surface
so we can deduce what the field of vision of our globular-eyed trilobite was bylooking at the directions in which all the lenses face
it turns out that our animal was able to see in almost every direction upwards downwards sideways and forwards and even backwards because the eyes bulged out beyond the line of the rest of the body
most other trilobites have a predominantly lateral field of view
if the animal lived on the sea bottom it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking and we begin to suspect that the animal habitually dwelt above the sea floor
other features of its shape are consistent with this 
at the �edge of the eyes are a pair of long spines and these point downwards at a steep angle at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor
most normal trilobites have a more or less horizontal rim around the forward margin which may have rested on the sediment surface
the thorax of the large-eyed trilobite is remarkably long compared with the average trilobite compare fig #
the convex middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated the appendages which as usual are not preserved and the relatively large volume of this region shows that the musculature was powerful
the construction of this giant-eyed trilobite suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom and possibly in the surface waters of the sea
of course because there are no living trilobites we cannot find direct confirmation of this hypothesis but we look for other arthropods that have the same modifications of the eyes for example in the present day oceans
the analogy is found in such ocean-going amphipods a kind of shrimp as which also has enormously expanded eyes looking headlamps compared with its bottom-dwelling relatives above 
in fact many of the arthropods that inhabit the water column have large globular eyes of this kind

giant-eyed living crustacean 
if it is correct that our trilobite lived above the sea bottom actively swimming in the water there are certain predictions we can make about its geological occurrence which can be tested bylooking in the rocks
most bottom-dwelling trilobites preferred to live at a particular water depth or on a particular type of sea bottom mud sand or lime
no such restriction should apply to our large-eyed species it should be found with all other different kinds of trilobite assemblages without preference
this has been proved in several places in some arctic localities it is found with trilobites that lived at great depths in the muds of the ordovician ocean while in canada the same species occurs mixed with the inhabitants of the shallow-water seas where limestones were accumulating
bythe same token the free-swimming trilobite may be expected to have a very wide geographical distribution for oceans would be no barrier to it
and again this proves to be the case our example is found in arctic canada in the high arctic island of spitsbergen thousands of miles away in what is now the desert country of nevada and utah in the united states in western ireland in russia and in northwestern australia
so in this case the different sources of evidence all point in the same direction whether derived from a detailed consideration of the way the trilobite is constructed or by analogy with living animals with similar adaptations or from the evidence of the rocks or the distribution of the fossils
these giant-eyed trilobites of the ordovician were active swimmers in the surface waters as near certainly as we can ever know
there are all kinds of different questions we can ask about the life habits of these trilobites which are not subject to the same kind of careful scrutiny
what did they eat for example
because we do not have the legs preserved it is not possible to see how the mouth appendages functioned in feeding and neither are the stomach contents preserved
so here there are only more or less likely speculations
active swimmers in the surface waters of the present oceans are likely to feed directly on the plankton and the trilobites may have had a method of harvesting large quantities of minute food
or they may have been hunters after larger prey in which case when appendages are eventually discovered they may prove to have adaptations for grasping and manipulating larger food
puzzles remain even though we can be certain of the rudiments of the story
controversy among the giant dinosaurs
the giant sauropod dinosaurs like were the largest land animals the world has seen they weighed more than # tonnes and present quite different problems in the interpretation of their life habits from the diminutive trilobites
such spectacular animals have obviously attracted much attention and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago
most of the popular books showing the mesozoic giants in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamps flanked bydeep vegetation their bodies largely under water
surely an animal of this bulk it was argued must be partly supported bywater and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft luxuriant vegetation that flourishes in and around swamps
because their nasal openings were on the top of their heads they could even continue to breathe if it became necessary p # to totally submerge
recently the life habits of the giants have been looked at in a way that disproves most of these traditional notions
consider the structure of their legs
the sauropods have relatively long pillar- legs resembling those of the elephant the largest land animal and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal
the feet of the sauropod are small relatively speaking with short stubby toes yet animals that walk on soft mud tend to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly
it is difficult to see how the compact feet of the sauropod could avoid becoming stuck fast in the soft muddy bottom of a lake
if the dinosaur did after all live on dry land then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow the animal to browse the high foliage of trees p #
it has been suggested that an animal of the size of could not have breathed under water because of the pressure on the lungs
their fossil remains seem to occur with other animals and plants which are generally accepted as terrestrial
there is even some evidence from the tracks they have left behind that and its allies moved about in herds
they may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also has its nasal openings on top of the skull with the nostrils in this case sited at the end of the trunk it has been suggested that some sauropods may have had a proboscis of some sort
the balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits 
but other aspects of the dinosaur living habits are still more strongly debated
in the last few years a powerful controversy has arisen over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were cold-blooded like all living reptiles and there is no doubt that dinosaurs reptiles or warm-blooded resembling mammals in this respect
cold-blooded animals have to warm up before they can be fully active that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates 
for this reason they cannot cope with climates having greatly extended winters
warm-blooded animals have the same body temperatures at all times and can be more continuously active but they use far more energy and hence need more food than cold-blooded animals of the same size
the posture of many dinosaurs and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs was fully erect with the legs beneath the body and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles p #
the long back legs of such hunters look highly suitable for running and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of counter-balance p #
for any kind of prolonged activity warm-bloodedness would have been a distinct advantage
under the microscope even the bone structure of these dinosaurs looks more like that of living mammals than cold-blooded reptiles
on the other hand it can be argued that the sauropods like were large and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller living reptiles
it has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants simply could not have downed enough food to support a warm-blooded metabolism particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy
the armoured or plated dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active but this does not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded
protagonists of the warm-blooded theory will show some of the horned dinosaurs charging over the cretaceous plains furious reptilian rhinoceroses 
one idea about the life habits of the dinosaur giants published in in #
the warm-blooded supporters tend to ally themselves with the supporters of a theory about the relationships of the dinosaurs
this is that the dinosaurs or a close dinosaur relative included the ancestors of the living birds
some of the smaller and most certainly highly active dinosaurs were about the size of a chicken and there is more than a passing similarity between a running ostrich and the kind of reconstruction that shows fleet-footed running dinosaurs
the point is that birds themselves are warm-blooded like mammals and if birds and dinosaurs are as closely related as now seems likely then it obviously increases the likelihood that the dinosaurs themselves may have been warm-blooded
the pros and cons of this theory are the subject of much contentious debate by experts but it would probably be correct to say that the greater number of specialists believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaurs including small and large carnivores were warm-blooded active animals
a lot of the argument among the authorities on these animals is about the equivalence or otherwise of certain bones in dinosaurs and bird skeletons and particularly the jurassic bird this makes for rather dry reading for the layman 
but the end- product is the accurate reconstruction of the jurassic and cretaceous terrestrial world over which the dinosaurs were indisputably dominant
 action and inaction in the cities
susanne macgregor and ben pimlott
the essays in this book do not amount to a programme but they are intended to provide a springboard for one 
the aim is to analyse a problem which economicgrowth alone has failed to cure and to consider possible new forms of public action 
the biggest single difficulty in drawing attention to urban poverty is that it is not new but simply in some of its most worrying manifestations getting worse
like the poor themselves the inner city has long been with us
ever since the industrial revolution created a mass urban society the conditions of the poorest city dwellers have given rise to anxiety among the better off 
the inner city has been variously regarded as a causefor moral outrage a threat to public order or as a stain on the nation's conscience 
meanwhile bad housing bad sanitation lack of education and other perennial ills associated with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leaders and social reformers
a central objective of the post-war welfare state was indeed to alleviate the problems of the urban poor over whom beveridge's five giants want disease ignorance squalor and idleness had for so long held sway 
in the early # and # the belief was widely held that a combination of government intervention in the form of town planning housing and health programmes and the provision of social security and permanent male full employment together with an increase in real wages would reduce suffering due to poverty to manageable proportions 
the # labour government was elected on a tide of impatience at the slackening pace of social reform but also of optimism that little more than economicgrowth fuelled bytechnological change was needed to remove the main causes of urban deprivation macgregor # 
disillusion swiftly followed 
the work of peter townsend and others showed that far from presiding over the elimination of poverty the wilson government actually failed to prevent some of its features from worsening townsend and bosanquet #
evidence began to mount that much of the social welfare paternalism of the post-war period had created almost as many problems as it solved 
neither the butler education act of # nor the introduction of comprehensive schools prevented a high proportion of children from under- 
post-war reconstruction and housing programmes seemed to do nothing to prevent and seemed even to encourage a rise in crime and mental illness
meanwhile in many parts of the country a problem as old as cities themselves tension between cultural groups between earlier immigrants and newer ones between black brown and white and increasingly between large sections of urban youth and the police came to be identified as the key inner-city issue
rising unemployment turned a lingering and growing malaise into a crisis 
as in the united states so in britain it was an outbreak of violence that dramatically brought the plight of the inner cities to public notice
in the early # at a time when manufacturing industry was collapsing and the outlook for the unskilled looked particularly bleak frustration boiled over in a series of riots in london bristol birmingham liverpool and elsewhere
all were spontaneous outbursts none contrary to some claims were politically inspired or orchestrated except in northern ireland where urban problems existed on a grander more devastating scale and where there was a unique heritage
many had an ethnic dimension in the sense that many of the rioters were black
unlike however the # notting hill riots few of those involved were immigrants the vast majority were british born
and the disturbances could not strictly be called racial the most prominent feature was that of violent clashes between young people and the police
the problems however were not confined violent upheavals of this kind
paul harrison's focused on hackney a london borough ranked among the worst off on any scale of urban deprivation harrison #
harrison describesp # the way in which the inner urban powder-keg leads to a vicious circle with many victims but few individual villains 
the police force face the virtually impossible task of keeping the lid on the explosive mixture of ingredients that the dynamics of british society have assembled in the inner city
this mixture heated by recession and high unemployment inevitably generates a high level of crime
this necessitates in turn a far more numerous and ubiquitous police presence than in other kinds of area far more frequent unpleasant contact with the public as potential suspects and far greater opportunities for police misjudgment or abuse
the inevitable sufferers of course are the poor of whom those who actually commit the offences that concern the police are a tiny minority and whom indeed it should be the purpose of the police to protect
not only are the most disadvantaged on the receiving end of most crime argues harrison they also have to put up with the heaviest police presence
they are more likely to be stopped and searched and to be the victim of mistaken arrest or conviction
at the same time the residents of the poorest areas have to suffer in a way that is not true of those who live elsewhere a growing fear of attack on themselves or their property
improved police methods might help writes harrison to contain the problem
but without other changes the result is likely to be a society of barricaded self-defence and a steady erosion of civil liberties 
and he concludes of all the warnings that the inner city has to offer for the direction british society is taking this is perhaps the most sinister
harrison's vision of a nightmarish future for inner cities locked in a cold or hot war between have-nots and the forces of public order was echoed by robert chesshyre # p # who concluded that by the late #
the basic social contract whereby citizens enjoy certain rights including health care decent education and housing and a job in return for which they observe the rule of law was breaking down 
as a consequence an underclass was evolving football hooligans muggers inner city rioters somewhat more frightening than their dickensian forebears because they were mobile and all too visible
recently of course there has been an added dimension part media-and-politician inflated part real drugs
the spiral in drug abuse and trafficking with direct consequences for the aids epidemic has createda new kind of alarm
the early # witnessed a radical change in patterns of heroin taking alongside the global increase
smoking heroin chasing the dragon was one feature of the upsurge
another was the increased availability of and demand for cocaine
sensational media and police reports in # seemed to suggest an increased use of crack among young people in parts of south london liverpool and birmingham with attendant fears that this particularly dangerous substance might become widespread as it was reported to be in parts of the united states
for the moment however the pattern of drug abuse in britain remains as varied as ever with home -produced drugs such as amphetamines as serious a problem as those that hit the headlines
it is a symptom of public anxiety about urban squalor and less creditably of class and racial prejudice that drugs and inner cities are automatically linked in the popular consciousness macgregor #a
nevertheless drug-taking and more particularly the disruptive social consequences of addiction are especially serious in areas of city poverty burr #
in short if life was always harder in the inner cities than elsewhere and if conditions may temporarily have been alleviated by the impact of the welfare state and rising incomes the last decade has been widely represented as a period of deterioration
moreover few would dispute that this apparent decline is a reality the first words of the prime minister herself after the result of the # election was known were an acknowledgement of the challenge posed to government by the inner cities
what has been lacking however as well as the political will to do something has been any shared agreement on the cause

the encouragement of private investment and the liberation of the market the containment of the forces of social discontent the control of the powers of the local authorities and the encouragement of the movement of the wealthy into the inner city thus creating buffer areas of tory support accentuating inequalities and injustice and hopefully though not necessarily reducing the potential for conflict among the urban poor
the main thrust of the government's policy is contained in the january # white paper on regional policy and the enterprise economy in the new employment training programme and especially in the march # programme all resting on wider reforms to local government structure and finance and to education and housing
the most striking feature of this package apart from its aim actively to involve employers and entrepreneurs is a sharp reduction in the role of local government
despite the contemporary tone of much of the programme's heritage can be traced to the early # studies which provided the basis for the # milner�holland report on housing and the # plowden report on education as a result of which general improvement areas and education priority areas were established
the # urban programme had a social rather than economic emphasis and was administered by the homeoffice
it was initiated partly in response to the furore caused by enoch powell's # rivers of blood speech much as disturbances at the # notting hill carnival prompted further steps on the part of the department of the environment a riot makes a much bigger impact on government thinking as donnison # has pointed out than any amount of earnest and accurate research
the urban programme consisted of grants and initiatives under the # local government grants social need act which was intended as a flexible instrument to provide supplementary help to local authorities in the fields of housing education and health
originally the programme supplemented existing central and local government schemes designed to meet special needs in urban areas
the scope was extended in an enhanced urban programme which included economic and environmental as well as social projects and was specifically directed at the inner urban areas where the problems were most severe 
earlier the change of emphasis from a social to an economic and environmental focus had been reflected in a switch of responsibility for the programme from the homeoffice to the department of the environment
the enhanced programme resulted from the # inner urban areas act based on a white paper published the previous year on doe # the first comprehensive policy statement on the subject to acknowledge it as a definable and cohesive problem
the white paper drew on studies conducted earlier in the decade in liverpool birmingham and london which pointed to a debilitating flight of capital and skilled labour from the critical areas of deprivation
a key aspect of the # white paper was the stress it placed on the wider effects of poverty that it was not just those with acute needs who suffered
it argued that in talking about inner cities it was vital to think in termsnot just of individuals but of society that the multiple deprivations of the worst hit areas affected all the residents that the consequences included a pervasive sense of neglect and decay a decline in community spirit a low standard of neighbourhood facilities and an increase in crime and vandalism and that without government intervention the future was one of reduced job opportunities deteriorating housing and a decline in public services
the document and the legislation that derived from it pointed to a positively discriminatory approach with both central and local government supplementing existing programmes in such a way as to strengthen local economies as well as the physical and socialenvironment 
such measures constituted the present government's heritage when it took office in #
none of them of course anticipated the scale of the problems which were caused by the slump and collapse of much of what remained of inner urban manufacturing industry in the early #
neither at first did the incoming administration foresee the impact of rising unemployment which was to be especially serious among the urban young
true the new secretary of state for the environment laid stress from the outset on the need for economicregeneration and indicated his sympathy for the voluntary in the tackling of urban problems
the previous government however had already pointed to the need to revitalize urban economies and at first the shift was more rhetorical than real
michael heseltine # p # has since claimed that we set a new objective to make the inner cities places where people would want to live and work and where the private investor would be willing to put his money
became his slogan the partnership of public and private brains and money
a new urban development grant was devised to pump-prime with public funds schemes which would then attract private investment
heseltine's vision was of partnerships which recognise that there are some things that only governments can pay for but also that the ingenuity and flexibility of the private sector is indispensable p #
he claims that serious work on inner-city policy began in # but it was undoubtedly the riots of # coinciding with the biggest drop in employment and job vacancies since the war which gave impetus to the new approach 
urban development corporations were introduced in # in london docklands and merseyside and the urban development grant came in late the following year
conservative instincts were of course to minimize within the partnership state involvement and expenditure relative to that of private enterprise
yet the irony of the early # as a deteriorating but perennial urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect of the crisis of mass unemployment was that a tory government willy-nilly found itself presiding over an increase in state intervention through a variety of agencies
the increased scale of operations also ushered in another fashion of the # new management structures 
thus in # city action teams were introduced to each inner city partnership area to co-ordinate the work of the three government departments involved
task forces meanwhile were directed to tackle youth unemployment
by # # the urban programme was supporting # starter units and # business starts in enterprise workshops 
it was providing # training places often in conjunction with the manpower services commission some # buildings were being improved estate action aimed to tackle run down housing and a large number of new partnerships which some might see as subsidies or discredited regional grants in a new guise were in operation in an effort to bring private investment to run-down urban areas
by # it was claimed that # million of urban development grant and urbanregeneration grant had successfully levered more than # million of private investment into the inner cities although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in any case is difficult to say 
meanwhile there were other incentive schemes enterprise zones for example and simplified planning zones which aimed to lift tax and planning barriers in order to facilitate investment
indeed while with one hand trying to hold down expenditure by local authorities the government found itself by the late # involved with the other hand in massive ear-marked spending on inner urban areas
the department of the environment alone by # was spending half a billion pounds out of an action for cities total involving most home departments estimated at # billion
perhaps a labour government would have spent even more it would certainly have spent it in different ways 
it is a curious comment on thatcherism however that the administration most committed to a reduction in the role of the state and in the need for an independent private sector has spent more on urbanregeneration and employment schemes and incentives to private investment in urban areas than any other in recent history
one of the most bizarre aspects of government policy has been the effective murder of the voluntary sector and its appropriation bysubterfuge into the tory version of the corporate state
conservatives have always lauded the voluntarist principle in welfare and encouraged it from platforms 
faced however with the catastrophic increase in unemployment and the need to occupy large numbers of workless people without directly employing them which would have run counter to the economic doctrine which had led to the redundancy of many of them in the first place the government poured money into any voluntary agency willing to put in a bid for government-funded cheap labour
one result was the triumphant expansion of some charitable organizations which rejoiced both at their new-found importance and at the government's munificence
another was the transformation of many such bodies already heavily subsidized from public funds into agencies of the state which financed them and indirectly determined their policy
nowhere was the impact of this clumsy sleight of hand more evident than in the inner cities where voluntary organizations had been most active and where the government was most anxious for them to mop up unemployment
however the later withdrawal of government support with the scrapping of the community programme as unemployment receded left many of these voluntary organizations high and dry 
the national council for voluntary organizations ncvo has suggested from a recent survey that around # projects had been affected and had lost # million in funding macgregor #
there was of course a crucial element in the government's anxiety the high concentration of ethnic minorities in the areas of concern
in # nearly # per cent of ethnic minorities in the uk lived in partnership or programme areas
there is a danger in reading back from this figureanother stereotype similar to the pavlovian drug addiction inner city assumed link 
some urban areas have serious problems without a major ethnic dimension newcastle teesside not all members of ethnic minorities are poor or deprived
nevertheless the high proportion of inner urban populations composed of people from ethnic minorities and the high incidence among these groups of all the indices of poverty and social and environmental hardship combined with the specific problem of inter-racial rivalry harassment and tension make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner cities and of any ameliorative approach
making sense of the # riots
reactions to the riots have concentrated on a number of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred
lord scarman's report on the # disorders highlighted the importance of unemployment urban deprivation racial disadvantage relations between young blacks and the police the decline of civic consent and political exclusion as the key issues
other reactions have concentrated on the issue of the interplay between inner-city decay and racial disadvantage in contemporary britain
yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen as a symptom of the breakdown of law and order in british society gaffney # hall # keith #
the main issues that were prominent in debates during #�# were race and law and order 
this was by no means an accident since throughout the # a powerful body of media political and academic opinion had been constructed around the theme of how britain was drifting into a violent society and how the basis of consent was being shifted bythe pressures of immigration and the growth of multi-racial inner city areas
a glimpse of the impact of the #�# riots at this level can be achieved through two important debates in parliament
the first took place in the midst of the july # riots and had as its theme civil disturbances
the tone of the debate was set byhome secretary william whitelaw's introductory statement in which he spoke of a the need to remove the scourge of criminal violence from our streets and b the urgency of developingpolicies designed to promote the mutual tolerance and understanding upon which the whole future of a free democratic society depends vol # # july # col #
the scourge of criminal violence was whitelaw argued a danger to the whole framework of consent and legality on which the political institutions of british society were based 
in reply roy hattersley supported the call for the immediate suppression of street violence but warned that the roots of such riots could not be dealt with until all people felt they had a stake in british society ibid cols #�#
the second debate took place on # november # on the publication of the scarman report and had as its theme law and order 
the importance of the riots in pushing the law and order issue and specifically policing on to the main political agenda was emphasized by the liberal leader david steel who argued that urgent action to prevent a drift into lawlessness was necessary from both a moral and a political perspective vol # # november # cols #�#
a subsequent debate on the same issue in march # was also full of references to the experience of # the impact of street violence crime decaying urban conditions the breakdown of consent between the police and many local communities and the spectre of more violence to come if changes in both policing tactics and social policy were not swiftly introduced vol # # march # cols #�#
the need to support the police was accepted by both the labour and the conservative speakers in the parliamentary debate on the riots and was established as a benchmark for the official response to the riots long before the scarman report was published in november #
any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets
intermingled with the discourses about race and law and order were constant references to unemployment particularly among the young and various forms of social disadvantage and poverty solomos # pp #�#
throughout # and # debates about the riots in the media in parliament and in various official reports hinged around the interrelationship between racial law-and-order and social factors 
the importance of this debate can be explained partly bythe political capital which the opposition could make from linking the social and economic malaise of the country at large with violent street disturbances
conversely throughout this period government ministers strenuously denied that unemployment and social deprivation were significant causes of urban unrest
although the scarman report is often taken to be the central text which argues for a link between social conditions and disorder the terms of the debate were by no means set by scarman
during both april and july # vigorous exchanges took place in the press and in parliament about the role that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have played in bringing about the riots
during the # july parliamentary debate on civil disturbances roy hattersley's formulation of this linkage provided a useful summary of the social conditions argument
after some preliminary remarks about the labour party's support for the police he went on to outline his opposition to the view of the riots as essentially anti-police outbursts
i repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week's riots was the conduct of the police
it was the conditions of deprivation and despair in the decaying areas of our old cities areas in which the brixton and toxteth riots took place and areas from which the skinhead invaders of southall come
 vol # # july # col #
much of the subsequent controversy about this analysis centred on the question of youth unemployment
hattersley had suggested that the riots were a direct product of high levels of youth unemployment and a furious debate ensued in both parliament and the media about this assertion
the final symbolic cue usedto make sense of the #�# protests is more difficult to categorize but its basic meaning can be captured bythe term political marginality
while a number of discussions of the roots of urban unrest in the united states have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protests skolnick # fogelson # edelman # knopf # this issue has received relatively little attention in britain
nevertheless during the #�# events and their aftermath the political context was discussed from a number of perspectives 
the scarman report for example located part of the explanation for the riots in the feelings of alienation and powerlessness which were experienced by young blacks living in depressed inner-city areas
a successful policy for tackling the roots of urban disorder was seen as one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problems of each area so that they could come to feel that they have a stake in its future scarman # para #
where such arguments did not fit in with the overarching themes of race violence and disorder and social deprivation they were either sidelined or pushed into the sub-clauses of official reports
the scarman report for example contained the following policy proposal i recommend that local communities must be fully and effectively involved in planning in the provision of local services and in the management and financing of specific projects scarman # para #
such a move towards greater political integration was seen by lord scarman as essential if the gap between inner-city residents and the forces of law and order was to be bridged 
but the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven byirrational uncivilized and criminal instincts
this did not however stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised at all as can be seen subsequently bythe attempts after # to introduce both locally and nationally measures which were meant to address some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur
aspects of these measures are considered further on in the chapter
perspectives on the # riots
despite widespread predictions of further unrest in the aftermath of # the scale and the location of the # riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators
handsworth for example was presented even shortly before september # as a success story in terms of police community relations
the outbreak of violence in this area was therefore widely presented as an aberration
similarly the spread of violence in london to areas such as the broadwater farm estate in tottenham was seen as a break from previous experience which had centred on areas such as brixton
there are many continuities between #�# and # in relation to the common-sense images usedin the press and television to cover the events
but responses in # were different at least in terms of degree and probably in relation to the extent to which the riots were seen as a race phenomenon bya wider body of opinion
the ambiguities and sub-clauses to be found in much of the press coverage during #�# had at least acted as a countervailing tendency against the more extreme forms of discourse which blamed the riots completely on black people
during the # riots and their immediate aftermath the imagery of race was used bysections of the press without the sense of ambiguity which could still be found in #�#
the silence over race was breached in #�# but in # debate about racial issues was taken a step further 
peregrine worsthorne for example usedthe ferocity of the confrontations in handsworth brixton and tottenham to argue that there was a major question mark over the possibility of assimilating the coloured population into mainstream british values sunday telegraph # september #
to be sure there was still a strong response opposing enoch powell's call for repatriation from all shades of political opinion but the racialization of public debate about the # riots went much further than #�#
in this context it was the externality of british afro-caribbeans and asians which was highlighted rather the racist institutions and processes which worked against blacks at all levels of society
the usage of race during the september-october # period took on new meanings which had little if anything to do with the impact of racism as such since the emphasis was on the cultural characteristics of the minority communities themselves
after handsworth part of the press response was to blame the riot on rivalry between west indians and asians and even after the arguments were criticized by local residents and community leaders they were usedto explain' what happened
in addition the question whether the cultures and values of the black communities their family structures and their political attitudes bred violence was constantly raised van dijk # 
the actual facts' of who was arrested during the riots whether black or white were hardly debated since it was assumed that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with crime keith #
the imagery of the black bomber usedin handsworth was extended to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw the riots as a chance to engage in an orgy of looting
the dear report on handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks
the majority of rioters who took part in these unhappy events were young black and afro-caribbean origin 
let there be no doubt these young criminals are not in any way representative of the vast majority of the afro-caribbean community whose life has contributed to the life and culture of the west midlands over many years and whose hopes and aspirations are at one with those of every other law-abiding citizen
we share a common sorrow 
it is the duty of us all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted bythe actions of a criminal minority
dear # p #
this black criminal minority was constructed not only into the leading force behind the riots but sometimes as the force
indeed throughout september and october # and during the following months the imagery of race continued to dominate debate about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots
as pointed out earlier the social causes argument was another major plank of public debate about the #�# riots particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment
during # this issue was raised once again though by then the extent of mass unemployment and urban de-industrialization and decay was more stark than it had been in #l
images of urban decay tinderbox cities and ghetto streets linked up with the images of race inequality and black ghettos to produce an analysis more complex but also more contradictory
an interesting mixture of the various images was provided bya story in the under the headline broadwater farm like the divis flats with reggae # october #
the described the estate as living hell and quoted one resident as saying that you've no idea how awful daily life is # october #
such images were reworkings of arguments already usedabout toxteth in # and brixton in # but they were used more widely than in #�#
even the which deployed the clearest use of race and outside agitator arguments ran a major story on broadwater farm under the headline burnt-out hulks litter this concrete jungle despair hangs heavy # october #
a number of stories using such imagery were run byboth the quality and the popular press during this period but similar arguments are to be found in parliamentary debates vol # # october # cols #-# # and even in official reports produced by the police on the riots in birmingham and london
the cities of inner despair were conceived as the breeding ground for disorderly protest and however hard the government tried to break the causal link between the two it was forced to take on board the need to restore order not only through the police but through promises of help for the inner cities
much as in #�# the social causes argument cannot be seen separately from the broader debate about the future of the british economy and society
the government's record on unemployment was a heavily politicized issue and just as in # it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riots through its pursuit of free-market policies
but the government did find a way of accepting a link between the riots and social problems without bringing its main policies into the debate namely bylinking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drugs
the emphasis on crime and the criminal acts of the rioters in the official responses to the # riots took a general and a specific form 
the general form relied on the argument that the riots were not a form of protest against the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police but a criminal act or a cry for loot 
this was an argument put most succinctly by geoffrey dear chief constable of the west midlands dear # and by douglas hurd the home secretary in relation to handsworth
but it recurred as a theme in official and press responses to the other riots
the specific form was built upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in handsworth and brixton in particular was brought about bydrug barons who saw the police attempting to curb their activities and control their territory
numerous examples of this line of argument can be found in dear's report on handsworth and in press coverage during the riots
taking the specific argument about the role of drugs and drug barons in stimulating the riots this seems to have served two purposes
first it distanced the riots from the social economic political and other grievances which had been linked to them bylocating the cause outside the social problems of inner-city dwellers and in the simple greed of the drug barons to accumulate loot 
second just as dear's image of a few hundred young black criminals was usedto explain what happened in handsworth the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level 
the issue of drugs provided an everyday image already a national issue through saturation media coverage and public debate around which the police the homeoffice and other institutions could depoliticize the riots
responding to the handsworth events douglas hurd was moved to argue forcibly that such events were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place the sound which law abiding people in handsworth heard on monday night the echoes of which i picked up on tuesday was not a cry for help but a cry for loot # september #
the chief constable for the west midlands geoffrey dear took this argument further bypointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place with the support of local community leaders
he drew the conclusion from this that the riot came like a bolt out of the blue # november #
such language focused attention on the individuals or groups who were breaking the law committing criminal acts and threatening the interests of the law-abiding majority
part # sociology and crime
explaining crime theories of criminality
most people have their own notions or theories as to what causes criminal behaviour
for example lack of discipline in the home genetic defects poverty mixing with the wrong sort have all been proposed as causes of criminality
while such notions may all contains some elements of truth they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour
this chapter will examine a range of theories which attempt to explain such behaviour
although the major theoretical explanations are covered in the numerous introductions to the sociology of crime and deviance and to sociology generally some review of these theories is necessary before embarking upon an examination of specific substantive examples of criminal behaviour
as this is not a book on criminological theories what follows will be a brief overview of a wide range of theories and explanations
first a word of warning might be in order 
it would be naive to expect to uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour given the extensive and diverse behaviour that is encompassed by the term crime
suppose for example that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision
it might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another
also there would be the further question of why the parents had not provided adequate supervision
perhaps this was because of their poor living conditions which would raise the question of why they were in poor housing
was this because of governmental housing policy or a poor employment record on the part of the bread-winner of the family
clearly we are getting further and further away from the causes of delinquent behaviour and it is perhaps wisest to think in terms of causal processes when looking at criminal behaviour
biological and psychological theories
before examining the major sociological on crime it is useful to refer to theories from outside of sociology from other academic disciplines
thus we will look initially at biological and psychological theories
biological theories
biological or physiological explanations are based on the notion that some individuals are predisposed to criminal behaviour because of their genetic make-up 
the individual criminal is born so and this is usually put down to faulty chromosome patterns or more vaguely to hereditary traits
the most famous exponent of this approach was the nineteenth-century italian physician 
in his book lombroso developed a complex description of what he called the born criminal who could be recognised bya variety of physical characteristics in particular facial characteristics for example large jaws and ears and high cheek bones
in the medical faculty at the university of rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to illustrate lombroso's theory
to use his own language
thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws high cheek bones prominent superciliary arches solitary lines on the palms extreme size of the orbits handle or sessile ears found in criminals savages and apes insensibility of pain extremely acute sight tattooing excessive idleness love of orgies and the craving for evil for its own sake
these explanations see the delinquent individual as inherently more prone to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent
they have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologists
lombroso's work for example was based on his examination of people in prison in italy
this would necessarily ignore the fact that many criminals do not go to prison and that perhaps people in prison are not always criminal
most advocates of biological theories do not express themselves in the same bizarre language and style as lombroso and such theories of crime are not merely historical relics that died with lombroso
in a major study of institutionalised delinquents delinquents in some form of custody in the usa in the # found that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build a chunky muscular compared with non-delinquent boys
however the fact that the study was restricted to institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the association between body build and crime and delinquency
it may be that tougher delinquents are more liable to be put away than fragile looking ones
furthermore it has been found that the association between delinquency on the one hand and height weight and physique on the other is greatly reduced once social background factors are taken into account 
for example lower working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour and this class grouping is more likely to be found represented in the criminal statistics
with regard to the links between criminal behaviour and inherited characteristics there have been a number of theoretical explanations suggesting an association between criminality and particular personality characteristics
an example of this more sophisticated biological approach is the work of hans eysenck who has argued in a series of studies that there is a link between genetically based personality characteristics and criminal behaviour
he maintains that there is a link between characteristics such as extroversion and criminal behaviour
an individual's degree of extroversion or introversion is inherited determined byhis or her genetic make-up 
the link with crime found by eysenck was that when prisoners were tested for extroversion more extroverts were found than in the general population
eysenck then argues that extroversion is the inherited basis of criminal behaviour
extroverts take longer to learn the rules of society they are more likely to break them and thus more likely become convicted criminals
as with lombroso's work and the gluecks' study discussed above bystarting with institutionalised criminals it is assumed that all prisoners are criminals and that most criminals do in fact go to prison
the people who get caught and imprisoned may not be a representative picture of all criminals
the major problem faced bytheories suggesting a link between genetic make-up and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between genetic and environmental effects
while some genetic influence cannot be ruled out just what is inherited remains very unclear
psychological theories
these theories share certain similarities with biological explanations
they stress the link between criminal behaviour and specific personality traits or characteristics
psychological theories however see these characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences rather than as inherited 
thus as with biological theories crime is seen as pathological a disease as something to be looked at from the medical point of view 
however psychological causes are seen as treatable whereas biological causes mark the individual for life
in those cases there is no possible treatment one is born a criminal
many psychological theories refer to faulty parent-child relationships such as abnormal experiences in early childhood having a lasting effect and influence on personality
studies in this area have indicated that too strict or too lax parental attitudes increase the risk of delinquency the work of john bowlby for example they have found that if a young child is deprived of close personal relationships with parents or parent figuresthen problem behaviour is more common
it is well established that in the delinquent-prone home discipline is more liable to be too lax strict or erratic
however it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children and this fact can hardly be usedto explain present patterns of crime
the majority of offenders do not come from disturbed or broken homes and many broken homes do not produce delinquents
of course this last point does not show that there is link between parent-child relations and crime and delinquency
the problem with assessing the influence of parental and family dimensions such as weak supervision or parental criminality is the fact that they are closely linked to various aspects of social and economic disadvantage such as poverty overcrowding and poor housing
and it may be that these disadvantages help to cause parental difficulties and hamper good parenting
we can hardly do justice to the wide scope of psychological theories here but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing
these stress the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years and conclude that anti-social and byimplication criminal behaviour results from faulty personality development 
to summarise these biological and psychological theories hold that the criminal is a particular type of person apart from the rest of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour
they are based on the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited or a consequence of unique individual experiences
before we look at sociological explanations it might be useful to ask yourself or to discuss with colleagues whether you feel that criminals are different types of person
while there are no doubt predispositions toward criminal behaviour and clearly certain characteristics are inherited most sociologists would reject these individual pathology sort of theories
they lack convincing supporting evidence
while some offenders suffer from mental disorders the vast majority do not
furthermore if criminals are abnormal then it follows that a large proportion of the population must also be abnormal
for numerous studies have shown that a high percentage of the population have committed criminal offences in particular high proportions of juveniles and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal
sociological theories
we said above that sociologists would reject non-sociological explanations of crime
this is not because such explanations are wrong but because they are incomplete or inadequate
in chapter one it was stressed that crime cannot be considered aside from its social context that it is dependent on society defining certain actions as criminal and on the reaction of others to such actions
potential applications 
overview
ian masser
given the extent to which geographic information management is applications driven it is important to consider in some depth the characteristics of some potential application fields 
in the process it will be necessary to examine not only the extent to which geographic issues feature on the policy issues agenda in these fields but also the institutional context which governs decision-making and the extent to which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes
questions on data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are heavily dependent on secondary sources 
in situations of this kind provisions governing access and format may exert powerful constraints on the usethat can be made of these data
the first four chapters in this part examine issues relating to geographic information handling in terms of four potential applications fields 
the authors were asked to review the current state of the art in their fields with particular reference to the likely requirements of the future policy issues agenda in terms of the demands that they make on geographic information management
authors were also asked to evaluate critically the state of geographic information provision in terms of the needs of users and to consider the impact of user requirements on the development of geographic information handling methodology
in this way the chapters in this part present a number of perspectives which essentially complement and amplify the discussion in the previous part 
in this case however methodological issues are tackled from a largely user standpoint whereas in the previous part they were viewed as substantive problems in their own right
in effect the product of the discussion in both parts is a matrix where the methodological issues are listed along one axis and particular applications fields on the other 
figure # summarizes the main features of this matrix
there are important differences between the chapters in this part both in the nature of the demands that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and decision-makers in these fields 
the first three chapters dealing with environmental monitoring natural and technological hazards and settlements and infrastructure applications make use of a very wide range of geographic information
a major feature of these applications is the extent to which they involve overlays of a variety of information drawn from different sources on a topographic map base 
for this reason they make particularly heavy demands on current gis technology both because of the size of the data sets and the diversity of the data structures that are involved
brown's chapter on geodemographics discusses an application field where primary data collected for operational purposes are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived from sources such as the census of population
the range of data sets involved and the demands that are made on gis technology in applications of this kind are often more limited than those of previous applications fields 
however this is offset bythe demands that are made on spatial analysis and modelling methodology
rhind's chapter on environmental monitoring and prediction discusses the role of geographic information management in promoting sustainable development on a global scale in the context of the issues identified in the brundtland report
it points to the impact that the findings of global environmental research are likely to have on most sectors of the uk economy
this contribution also indicates the wide variety of groups that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draws attention to the role that the european community is increasingly playing in co-ordinating these efforts
one of the examples of work in progress discusses research that has been carried out for the european commission as part of the corine project
this highlights the challenges for research in a field categorized by a lack of data for some countries varying definitions and standards in use and unreasonably high user expectations
the chapter as a whole draws attention to a number of key methodological issues that are involved in environmental monitoring and prediction
these include the highly specialized nature of much of the technical analysis the limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many of the findings of this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of knowledge-based inference machines for extracting useful information from secondary and often proxy data
in chapter # gatrell and vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazards including industrial hazards risk assessment hazardous waste disposal emergency planning natural hazards and environmental epidemiology
the substantive content of much of this research straddles the social environmental and mathematical sciences
to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and its impact on the surrounding area for example an understanding of atmospheric dispersion models epidemiology and population distribution would be required
in applications of this kind the authors argue that geographic information management in general and gis in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of examples from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field
the discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters particularly with respect to the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets
like most of the other contributors to this section gatrell and vincent see decision support systems as a major area for future development in the geographic information management field
given that most gis are rather dumb systems requiring intelligent very computer literate users managing natural and technological hazards means that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained users after a disaster has taken place or in an emergency
the settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests
these include not only central and local government but also major utility companies and transport suppliers
according to shepherd these users share a common need for up-to-date information on the amount capacity and condition of urban land transport networks utilities hospitals schools and other major communal facilities
in addition to these data requirements such users are also interested in developing their capabilities for modelling the changing relationships between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector decision-making
shepherd more than any other contributor to this section draws attention to the extent to which current efforts in the geographic information management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data suppliers and users both in sectoral and spatial terms the great diversity of data sets in varying formats and the difficulties presented by institutional factors such as copyright provision data ownership and the control of access to data
digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision
in chapter # brown reviews the development of geodemographics from its origins in the computer-based social area analysis of us census tract data from # onwards
he describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the uk and illustrates their application with reference to examples drawn from retail analysis and store location market research credit rating and target marketing
brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activities in this field has led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic methods for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live
in the last part of this contribution brown identifies a number of priorities for future research
like gatrell and vincent and shepherd before him he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the years between censuses
spatial linkages also feature prominently in brown's discussion which amplifies many of the points made in the earlier contribution from openshaw in chapter #
the analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors
other major research priorities for the future in this applications field are the development of response-modelling techniques to explore the factors affecting consumer choice
this is particularly important in a field where many of the demands made by users are highly specialized in nature
in summary then as fig # shows many of the issues raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application fields are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological developments
spatial analysis features particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazards and geodemographics
questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical in terms of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications
spatial linkages and questions relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlements and infrastructure and geodemographics fields
the evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields
finally in all applications fields the findings of the reviews above suggest that there is a need for improvements in user interfaces of all kinds
this is particularly evident in the demand for the development of knowledge-based decision support systems and modelling capabilities
such demands highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded as a means to an end rather than an end in itself when viewed from the standpoints of the needs of planners and decision-makers
the final chapter in this section rounds off the discussion of applications-related research with an examination of organizational issues that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information
campbell presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issues involved in the development and implementation of gis
this contribution cuts across many of the questions relating to particular applications that were raised in preceding chapters and draws attention to the dangers of neglecting institutional and personal considerations in practice
all too often as the experience of many mature applications indicates technical and data-related matters dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solutions are devised which fail to take enough account of user needs and capabilities
campbell discusses the role of geographic information in organizations and the process of gis diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science disciplines
the findings of the analysis are summarized in two sets of research questions for all applications fields
in this way she sets out a research agenda for applications-related research which serves a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by openshaw at the beginning of part two 
environmental monitoring and prediction
david rhind
introduction
monitoring of the state of and the changes in the environment is now universally recognized as being of profound importance to mankind tickell # #
this awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press reports on ozone depletion on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming on nitrate pollution on deforestation in the tropics on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topics
usually these reports concentrate on prophecies of a forthcoming armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation
thus the algal bloom off the italian adriatic shore in # is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman losses running into tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds
more globally the brundtland report wced # noted that in the # days during which the world commission was at work
#
the african drought put the lives of # million people at risk and may have killed # million of them
#
the bhopal accident killed # and injured # # more
#
the chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across europe
#
a chemical fire in switzerland caused toxic materials to be transported by the rhine at least as far as the netherlands
#
at least # million people died of diarrhoeal diseases caused by malnutrition and dirty water
as a consequence of these and other disasters of rapid and world-wide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals the environment is now moving fast up the political agenda patten #
the then prime minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment in statements such as it is possible that with all these enormous changes population agricultural use of fossil fuels concentrated into such a short period of time we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself thatcher #
the political concern is not altruistic
mrs thatcher a recent convert to environmental conservation clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective
in the past when we identified forms of pollution we have shown our capacity to act effectively
the great london smogs are now only a nightmare of the past
we have cut airborne lead by # per cent
we are spending # billion on cleansing the mersey basin alone and the thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world
even though this kind of action may cost a lot i believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other
the government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development
stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded thatcher #
the primary official manifestation of this uk commitment to the environment has been the government's white paper hmso #
while criticized by many on the grounds that it had few teeth and represented a compromise between the doe and all other departments notably those of agriculture and of transport it was none the less a major achievement
its main sections dealt with the government's approach to the environment nationally at the european level and globally the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect environmental problems in both rural and urban areas especially in relation to land-use matters pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters
central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence
there is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment
though there has been a change of prime minister and of the secretary of state for the environment since the publication of the white paper the environmental cause seems as strong as ever
thus of # december # reported that a group of # of the most senior civil servants had met the previous weekend to discuss ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems such as the threat of global climate change
pearce # have argued that the effects of government commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the uk government will proceed
given such a lead it is scarcely surprising that british scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes table # for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the uk domestic economy
if it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary indeed is even vital the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important the # # people in the maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the islands is more than # m above present sea-level
yet as we shall see below the prediction of the activities of natural and man-influenced environmental systems requires an understanding of the interaction of processes that in many cases we simply do not yet have
even monitoring of the present is very imperfect as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates
this chapter then attempts to review some of the problems in environmental monitoring and prediction describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activities and looks ahead to what is likely to happen next
the nature of environmental processes
notwithstanding mrs thatcher's confidence that we can fix environmental problems the difficulties associated with a task even as apparently simple as monitoring a state variable are considerable
some of the reasons for this the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variables and on economical yet non-biasing temporal and spatial sampling frameworks taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare events as compared to near-continuous processes processing the vast volumes of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and often multinational researchers involved are discussed briefly later
even at this stage however it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many processes in the natural environment
the next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know it is derived chiefly from the earth system sciences committee essc #
temporal and spatial scales of operation
even ignoring the effects of man earth system processes operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales see fig # see also rosswall #
thus microclimate effects can have major short-term implications for local populations such as those brought about by the photochemical smogs of los angeles are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle
in contrast soil creation cf soil degradation may require hundreds or thousands of years
in between are variations in phenomena such as 
the sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement
in this chapter the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about # m to about # km
it is however impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades
conversely a large-scale and long-period phenomenon such as the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects
this therefore has the following consequences
#
we should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends
#
since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge such as via tree rings palynology oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change
#
since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise
#
we must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced
#
irrespective of the use of surrogates monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over time-scales which are extended by human standards hence the igbp see below is designed to run for two or three decades
#
changes in political priorities may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available
much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis
this is not merely because of its topical nature
the main reason is that though some problems are local and are best studied that way many others even involving a limited geographical extent are best understood within a global framework
thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather # or # days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world
moreover recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the north atlantic every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the drake passage and up into the atlantic
thus to understand some local and many regional national and continental and all global environmental events we need to have a global perspective and hold global databases rhind and mounsey # mounsey and tomlinson #
in no way however does this invalidate the need for microscale studies for instance while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may causes of them only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring 
the processes themselves
a major complication however is that the environment can rarely be treated as in a laboratory experiment
given this determining the nature of the interactions between the variables becomes a matter of major difficulty
figure # is taken from essc # and is an attempt to show the interactions between environmental processes as well as the indicators and implications of change in the state of the environment
in essence the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities
the main components of the first system are well known the atmosphere is its engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in solar heating between the equatorial and polar regions
we are however becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of oceans on our climate research into ocean atmosphere interactions is now a priority
in ocean dynamics studies important topics are heat storage circulation and the role of sea ice
atmospheric circulation and in turn precipitation and temperature is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristics
the biogeochemical system embraces the totality of the movements of the key elements essential to life carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and others through what has been described as the total earth system
the oceans and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycles global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget
trace gases in the atmosphere are key components of the cycles of such elements as carbon nitrogen oxygen sulphur and the halogens as is now well known their concentrations are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activities and the concentrations of such gases as carbon dioxide ozone methane nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes cfms strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system
a particular cause for concern is that the concentrations of the two main cfms is increasing by about # per cent per annum while the equivalent figures for methane nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are # # and # per cent
finally the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone
there are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost
if for instance the concentrations of certain trace gases see above continue to increase it has been predicted that the earth's surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation about # # years bp though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change
the converse case the effect of physical climate changes on biogeochemical processes is also of obvious importance changes in annual averages and cycles of temperature and precipitation together with the probabilities of extreme events such as prolonged droughts or frosts are major determinants of terrestrial ecosystem type at least in areas largely unaffected by human activity
human-induced changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology
fossil fuel combustion for instance has led to increased concentrations of sulphate in precipitation acid rain' and many rivers lakes and estuaries have been greatly affected by phosphates from agricultural urban or industrial sources
it should be stressed however that while the outlines of human activities are clear there are still many uncertainties for instance we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about # per cent since #
but calculations of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere the concentration would have increased by twice as much
the absolute difference between the two figures seems to be due to two different factors absorption by the oceans and other reductions in carbon stocks in living biota the latter being strongly affected by human activities since the industrial revolution
does god play dice
much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or newtonian deterministic basis
the environmental systems are effectively regarded as machines whose workings can all be discovered described in differential equation form and whose future activities can thus be predicted in detail if their initial states are known
an argument by many atmospheric physicists for example is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power see fig # derived from tyler #
in contrast the advocates of chaos theory eg stewart # argue that some natural systems are so sensitive to tiny stimuli that even the faint beat of a butterfly's wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane
in essence they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework
if so there is little chance of making accurate long-term forecasts of these systems
this has been recognized by among others essc #
the authors of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of #�# weeks in explicit prediction of day-to-day fluctuations in weather because of the influence of small-scale turbulence within the large-scale dynamics such limits imply that medium and long-term prediction must inevitably be stochastic
to complicate matters still further however it seems at least possible that the components of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scales but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different components
as an example atmospheric temperature shows marked day-to-day variability a strong seasonal cycle with some year-to-year variations a weak minimum variability for #�# year averages and then increased variation again at longer time-scales essc #
it need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple databases on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise
finally it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed
in general the research work of the international groups of scientists including those involved in the inter-governmental committee and in the uk's inter-agency committee on global environmental change has progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effects of for example global warming
in giving the # robens coal science lecture at the royal institution sir john mason a former director of the meteorological office urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans etc lower values of predicted changes are likely
thus while almost all scientists are at the time of writing convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effects may be much greater than the global average the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what was predicted only # years ago
who is involved and what is going on
if we consider the environment in the broadest sense much monitoring of it has been in progress for many years and by an enormous diversity of organizations in the uk these include the doe the forestry commission the nature conservancy the health and safety executive local authorities the component members of the natural environment research council such as the institute of terrestrial ecology and the british antarctic survey individuals or research groups in academia the cegb the friends of the earth and uk centre for economic and environmental development ceed #
the diversity of monitoring organizations seems just as great in other countries numerous multinational organizations both quasi-governmental eg the un environment programme unep and non-governmental eg the international union for the conservation of nature iucn and the international institute for environment and development iied are also active in the field
moreover commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine notably to predict crop yields in the main grain-growing areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures
the international scientific involvement
scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment
thus at the global scale the international council of scientific unions icsu has endorsed the setting up of the international geosphere biosphere project igbp to describe and understand the interactive physical chemical and biological processes that regulate the total earth system the unique environment it provides for life the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions report of planning group for igbp # quoted in igbp #
priority in the igbp is intended to be given to those areas which deal with key interactions and significant changes on the time-scales of decades to centuries that most affect the biosphere that are most susceptible to human perturbations and those that will most likely lead to a practical predictive capability for global change
this is to be put into operation by concentrating on four themes
#
documenting and predicting global change
#
observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing functions
#
improving our understanding of interactive phenomena in the total earth system
#
assessing those effects of global change which will be large scale and cause major modifications to both renewable and non-renewable resources
by # igbp had progressed as far as defining a set of seven core projects igbp # addressing these four themes
in addition plans for regional research centres and for the data and information systems for igbp known as igbp-dis had been announced
the latter are particularly relevant to this chapter
based in paris and working under professor i rasool it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspects of the task in the first # years #�# but then to expand considerably thereafter
tasks agreed for the igbp-dis include making available a directory of data directories modelled on nasa's master directory providing data sets for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study
until # remarkably little interaction had taken place between the hard science and the social science communities on global monitoring and prediction
it is noteworthy however that the royal society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in its submission on greenhouse gases to the house of lords' select committee on science and technology royal society # #
fortunately in addition to the actions of the world hard science community a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientists fuchs # jacobson and price #
currently this is organized and sponsored by the international social science council issc the un university and the international federation of institutes of advanced studies
its objectives are to
#
improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total earth system
#
study explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment
#
identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable
#
analyse policy options for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development
jacobson and price # provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to and are affected by likely global changes in particular they stress the importance of the data-handling issues and the role of gis in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation
the issc proposed its own work programme in the human dimensions of global change in late #
while these organizations intrinsically have a world-wide membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base
a leading example of this is the european science foundation which has sponsored research programmes in both the physical and social science aspects of environmental change esf #
governmental and political involvement
the spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated in # # countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas a decade later the number was # wec #
in most countries the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people the early development of the green party in the federal republic of germany is something of an exception
such a commitment to the environment is none the less both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing let alone forthcoming environmental problems
the conversion of the uk government has been briefly described earlier it is manifested in their july # commitment to spend #m on climate change research in # # and the confident request to them from the advisory board for the research councils abrc for an extra #m in # and #m in the two succeeding years for additional environmental research
perhaps the most significant development of all however is the increasing role of the european commission
their role in bringing environmental impact assessment eia on to the statute book is well known but the commission has now made a proposal cec # for the establishment of the european environment agency and the european environment monitoring and information network
the commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a european scale nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a community-wide basis a realization brought about through the corine programme described later
the objectives of the new agency would be to assist the community and the member states to achieve the goals set out in the treaty of rome and in successive environmental action programmes it must also however be seen in the context of the european council's adoption on # december # of the rhodes declaration on the environment and the environment chapter in the single european act which comes into effect in #
the detailed specific roles of the system comprising both agency and network are envisaged as
#
to provide the community the member states and participating third countries with the objective sic information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policies
#
in particular to provide technical scientific and economic information requested by the commission in its tasks of identification preparation and assessment of the implementation and results of environmental action and legislation
#
to stimulate the development and the application within the agency of techniques of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time
#
to help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the community as well as the integration of european environmental data into international environmental monitoring programmes such as those established within the framework of the united nations and its system of agencies
considerable stress is laid by the commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agencies and with states adjacent to the community's borders
it is envisaged that the totality of activities will extend the existing report cec # through addressing the issues of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressures upon it
priorities for the new agency include study of atmospheric emissions and quality water resources and quality including the marine environment soil erosion and pollution and important land resources and biotopes and nature conservation
at the time of writing the proposal has been approved and discussions are in progress on the location of the agency's headquarters
it seems certain to have major and growing effects upon environmental monitoring and prediction in europe and on the policies of component governments
yet this is by no means the only plan which the community has in relation to the environment directorate-general xii that for science research and development has published details of an extensive r&d programme cec #a and the commission as a whole cec #b has made public its plans to develop regular official statistics of the environment
the private sector
certain aspects of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector notably that of crop states on a world-wide basis
derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution predicted yields for different crops in different nation states become of commercial value
however significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain thus ibm uk ltd has donated #m of computing equipment to unep and ibm in general is actively supporting other r&d which can be expected to facilitate sustainable development ibm europe for instance has invested #m in its bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development
on a more modest basis ibm uk have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in birkbeck college to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population
many other companies of course are supporting environmental work but ibm seems almost to be unique in its corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating sustainable development
some examples of environmental monitoring projects
the local scale
at the local scale it is usually impossible to neglect the effects of multiple processes operating
an example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by haber and schaller #
their work formed part of one unesco man and biosphere mab project carried out in the berchtesgaden national park in bavaria
following holling # and grossman # they conceptualized the man environment relationship at a series of hierarchical levels
#
the lowest or process level is directly and usually obviously connected to perceived reality
thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious simple and linear data are usually readily available and may be voluminous
this level is readily handled in commercial gis
#
the intermediate or dynamic level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events eg a temporary lack of water because of fire frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace
characteristically the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential
#
the top or strategic level is the most difficult to explore the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means
relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available
the haber and schaller approach is to soft-couple these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model
results of running this with different scenarios include time slice maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area
while ultimately qualitative it seems to offer a method for coping with different types of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random events
the national and continental scale the corine project
the corine programme represents the product of much activity by the european commission's directorate-general xi for the environment
it originates from an italian request to the council of ministers in # to identify environmentally balanced and unbalanced areas in the community the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and though by # it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one funding for this was not secured until #
a #-year experimental programme to collect co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the european communities was set up and labelled corine
the objectives of corine were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holdings in the member states developing methods for holding analysing and presenting the data and encouraging the exchange of data
a number of priority areas were identified including biotopes of importance for nature conservation acid deposition and its effects on soils and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the mediterranean region briggs and martin #
many achievements can be claimed by the corine project team
as a result of some # sub-projects involving all the member states and often several groups within each one databases of topography soils water resources and quality biotopes atmospheric emissions climate soil erosion and administrative boundaries have been built up for the whole community and can be interrelated other data sets such as land cover derived from satellite imagery have already been compiled for some of the member states
various aspects of the corine project have been described in papers by rhind # wiggins # briggs and martin # briggs and mounsey # and cec #c
for the present purposes however the key findings are
#
many necessary data sets were unavailable for reasons of administrative inadequacies confidentiality constraints cost or non-collection in certain countries
#
the unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems due to non-harmonization even of commonly used variables eg eight different definitions of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the member states and maximum temperature at each weather station was defined in at least four different ways
#
the compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organizations at different scales and on different topographic bases see rhind and clark # is often difficult
#
user expectations are often unreasonably high use of administrative computing systems encourages bureaucrats to believe that environmental data can just as readily be analysed and used to support decisions
the fuzzy nature of much geographically distributed data the inherent errors in it the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future
#
more detailed data are required for particular tasks as the role of corine grows
the european commission's proposal for an environment agency see above will subsume the corine team and databases
the global scale nasa and gems grid
without question the largest player in the global environment arena is nasa
the organization has initiated many of the schemes which now are under discussion the igbp for instance has been strongly influenced by nasa proposals
a summary of current activities and future plans is given in nasa #b
by way of example current programmes are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone on sea-surface and sea-ice variables and on the earth's radiation budget
approved future programmes include the upper atmosphere research satellite the nasa scatterometer and the joint nasa cnes ocean topography experiment
in addition however funding has recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme the earth observing system eos
this is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the essc see above and anticipating somewhat those of igbp
it will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platforms one european space agency platform a japanese one and also from the manned space station
on this basis a data flow of no less than # terabyte ie #&sup# bytes /day is anticipated by the mid-#
a major user of nasa data and skills has been the un environment programme
formed in the wake of the # stockholm conference unep soon spawned the global environment monitoring system gems as well as an international register of potentially toxic chemicals and a global network of sources to locate and provide technical scientific and management information on the environment
the need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data was defined in the early # and the global resources information database grid resulted
mooneyhan # has described the progress of the pilot stage of grid which culminated in approval for a full operational phase grid is now involved in integrating storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases mostly acquired from nasa
in addition to the work being carried out in the unep hq at nairobi and in the gems grid site in geneva a series of grid regional nodes are now being set up world-wide each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subsets of the data
the first of these is in bangkok and another is to be opened in latin america
moreover national nodes are also being set up the recent ibm gift to grid see above has ensured that powerful microcomputers have been installed in many african countries together with national and continental data sets
training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for grid staff
technical aspects and problems
it follows from much of the above that there are major challenges in use of environmental data
these are best considered by itemizing characteristics of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction
#
the use of secondary data rather than primary data collected by the data analyst
#
the need at least with data on the terrestrial environment for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary and often proxy data
#
the data volumes collected are often voluminous even by the standards of contemporary computing facilities
#
the analyses carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of high priests
#
we have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results let alone of predictions
some of these characteristics are now addressed in slightly more detail it will be obvious that such problems merit a paper in themselves
remote sensing as a data collection process
as the need for more extensive high-resolution yet consistent and up-to-date data becomes more pressing increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable
no other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states
the problem is now recognized especially in europe and strenuous efforts are being made to harmonise the data sets eg through the use of standard classifications such as that for land use produced by the conference of european statisticians in #
at present however ground-collected environmental data are far less than ideal
recognizing this nasa #a concluded that forthcoming global science projects would need land surface altitude data at three resolutions # km resolution in xy and #�# m resolution in z on a global basis # m xy resolution and #�# m resolution in z for regional databases and # m xy resolution and #�# m in z for local studies
they argued that existing maps and digitized files from them are unable to meet these needs at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term the availability of stereometric data from the french spot satellite has already led to proposals for automated creation of global digital elevation models with a spatial xy resolution of about # m muller #
for many terrestrial purposes however a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurements into useful information in contrast more direct measurements of sea state etc are possible
the value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene the spatial temporal and spectral resolution of the sensors and the particular algorithms used
thus far for instance accuracies of land cover let alone what is often needed ie land use determined from landsat and spot imagery for the uk have rarely been higher than # per cent unless trivial classifications eg built unbuilt land have been used
one solution to this is to densify the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers rather than the traditional spectrally based ones
but the ground conditions in some parts of europe make good results extremely difficult to obtain some areas of portugal for instance have field sizes of only a few metres and exhibit multi-level and multi-seasonal cropping
a further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to its anticipated benefits
relatively few cost benefit studies have yet been carried out except in such areas as crop prediction and ocean navigation where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else's money
it may be that a study commissioned from contractors by the british national space centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of professor pearce see above as the adviser to the uk secretary of state for the environment
other work on assessment of costs and benefits of such data have been carried out for the french government by professor didier #
finally since data are often costly to acquire it follows that summaries of them eg report cec # and the of the un ep gems marc # are of considerable value
equally the signposting role now being adopted by unep's grid project which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in # is to be welcomed
the data problem and partial solutions
the lack of harmonization of definitions and methods of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above
in the european community of # nation states for instance no less than eight procedures for calculating potential evapo-transpiration have been in use
the need for harmonization is obvious and in this respect must follow from the successful pioneering achievements of eurostat in harmonizing the definitions in trade demographic and other social science statistics see cec #b
an additional and severe problem is that the volumes of data which are already collected are huge by the standards of only a decade ago
by # # they will be very much greater notably from the eos programme
nasa has announced plans to collect up to # terabyte #&sup# bytes /day
since remote sensing data sets especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe typically need much pre-processing to calibrate transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful eg land cover data the processing power required is going to be formidable
other non-remote-sensing data sets are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristics
to hold all of the # # # scale topographic map coverage alone for the european community would probably require about # terabytes of storage
parenthetically the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced
it would be technically possible for instance to hold in less than # terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world akin to that collected about everyone in the uk through the census of population
in practice legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form the cross-tabulations commonly employed eg to give tables of population numbers broken down by age and sex often result in a great multiplication of the data volumes
this all presents major problems of data storage handling especially for global data sets display and dissemination
fortunately technical developments have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost has been growing at about an order of magnitude every # years over the last three decades
indeed this may grossly under-represent the present situation the rapid spread of unix-based systems seems to facilitate competition and at the time of writing performance of workstations per unit cost seems to be increasing at about # per cent per annum
moreover the advent of low-cost high-density-storage devices like cd-roms may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power a cd-rom for instance can hold about # megabytes ie #&sup# bytes can be reproduced currently for about # and read on a device costing about #
yet despite such revolutionary changes in technology novel solutions will still be required to make effective use of the new data sets
one such solution is goodchild and yang's # scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth
a particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard has been paid until recently to the effects of quality variation in environmental data
the literature of the last few years is thronged with papers proposing that these must be taken into account but with few realistic proposals on how this is to be achieved
goodchild # has made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solutions to date
finally relatively little emphasis has been given to the management of data as a corporate resource available to a wide community many environmental data are collected on a project-by-project basis and lost once the urgency of the initial research is over
however the # report of the data and facilities working group of the uk inter-agency committee on global environmental change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data was a vital role
it also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data was a policy matter of the greatest importance this may be more difficult in within country data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreements at zero cost 
global environmental research and the social sciences
thus far the emphasis has been very much on the natural science aspects of environmental monitoring and prediction
that is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problems and assessments of some of their causes and magnitudes can only be made by environmental scientists
yet the consequences of any significant changes are a matter of the utmost concern to planners and to politicians at all levels the quantification of the costs and benefits of alternative policy strategies is very much a matter for economists and the adaptation of societies to massive change is a particular interest to sociologists and others
for geographers who span the conventional and now archaic dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change the redistributions in trade health and wealth which they will bring about and the knock on effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment
for social scientists then environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance especially as globalization of markets and economies proceeds
the economic and social research council esrc commissioned two reports on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding
these reports pearce # turner # may be taken as informed views from at least the economists in the uk social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change
pearce # for instance presented an economist's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows
#
the theory and practice of international agreements viewed in a game theory context
#
the theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty
#
cost-benefit frameworks especially for dealing with man-induced climatic effects
#
definition of the impacts of climate change on eastern europe and the developing countries
#
appropriate policies on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases
#
assessment of the ecological values of tropical forest
#
economic instruments for reducing greenhouse gases
#
the international politics of climate change
#
national and global energy options given the greenhouse effect
#
trade and global change
turner # argued that the priorities are as follows
#
the socio-economic consequences of sea-level rise
#
techniques for the valuation of environmental resources and effects
#
an assessment of management tools institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change
#
studies of agriculture in relation to climate change
#
understanding of how environmental issues and technical change interact
#
the interrelationship between environmental ethics and economics
there is then no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change
some of it is being carried out in march # esrc announced a #m programme of research on global environmental change
however perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice rather than research
in the usa at least there needs to be an improvement in scientists' understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research see kitsos and ashe #
all too often it seems that the coupling of an as yet imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous see table #
fortunately considerable high-quality work has already begun on the legal political and institutional aspects of global environmental change see for instance nitze #
what next
the contents of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research as the world ocean climate experiment or the world climate research programme
nor has there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the uk as elsewhere to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major developments
the consequences for some nations or subgroups in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tools for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound as the european commission has recognized in issuing a directive on public access to environmental data cec #d yet space limitations have also precluded their discussion
despite these shortcomings dictated by the space available what has been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction
such is its diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of actors already involved is vast
what is clear however is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise that the time-scales of the sponsors of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based schemes
in these circumstances it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute as terney # has chronicled in regard to igbp
moreover as newby # has pointed out the complexities of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy in the past the relationship was predicated on the belief that science provided decision-makers with objective hard facts on which to base their soft value-ridden policies
but now we find scientists delivering only soft uncertain facts to decision-makers facing hard decisions
yet even if all of this causes great uncertainty among scientists it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated as an everyday need and activity in major organizations
we shall also see the existence of binding requirements upon national governments certainly in the european community to collect at least basic environmental indicators in a harmonized form cec #b
more than that it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies
perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring modelling and management of the global environment are tasks which uniquely require the integration of skills and techniques from many disciplines
building such research teams is essential
underlying it all however is one obvious fact that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth

managing natural and technological hazards
anthony c gatrell and peter vincent
introduction
few areas of the application of gis technology can be as socially significant or environmentally relevant as the management of emergencies and disasters due to natural and technological hazards
whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances or monitoring the health implications of a disaster gis can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions
the # have been declared the 
let us hope that g#s can in some small way help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the uk can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places
research on hazards is multidisciplinary and straddles the social environmental and mathematical sciences
if for instance we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require for example a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models epidemiology and population distribution
some researchers suggest that hazards and emergencies that might result can be regarded as either natural or technological
we shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former see for instance burton # and perry # has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter
there are signs that this imbalance is being rectified zeigler #
hazard research like few other gis application areas is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related areas such as expert systems and simulation studies
in this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problems looking for improved gis rather than for gis looking for good problems as is all too often the case
hazard research
what are hazards
formally a hazard can be defined as a physical situation with a potential for human injury damage to property damage to the environment or some combination of these health and safety executive # #
a hazard is a threat which given a set of circumstances may become translated into a realized event
what we choose to call this event depends upon factors such as its magnitude we speak for instance of accidents emergencies disasters and catastrophes each of which carries connotations concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human and or environmental consequences
on # march # one of the most powerful volcanic disturbances this century the bezymianny eruption occurred
few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of kamchatcka and caused no known casualties
in contrast the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of tristan da cunha became the focus of global interest when during october # the island's lobster processing plant was smothered and the # people of the island's only settlement were evacuated to the uk
these two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area
as noted above the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced
each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in fig # draws upon the classic work of burton and kates # in separating geophysical from biological hazards and zeigler # in distinguishing public or what we might call societal hazards from private individual ones
the further subdivision of natural hazards is self-explanatory as is that of individual technological hazards
zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers
the united nations disaster relief organization undro has produced a classification of disasters derived on the basis of case data table #
undro recognizes three basic types of disaster accidents natural events and other disasters
the differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typologies
however the temptation in all classification exercises is to produce partitional schemes and this should really be resisted here
it is more useful johnson # to adopt a non-partitional scheme fig # that recognizes for instance food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard or lead pollution eg from car exhausts as both a meteorological event and technological hazard both public and private
an air crash as at lockerbie affects an entire community directly as well as being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller
hillslope failure as at aberfan in south wales in # is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction
dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected logs
hohensemer # make the important point that hazards are multidimensional in nature and suggest # dimensions along which any hazard may be scored see table #
these factors will of course be important in deciding on the role that gis can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning
for instance some events will persist briefly have immediate consequences minor transgenerational effects and have little or no potential for non-human mortality an air crash is an example
others such as a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas may persist for a week or more have delayed consequences may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations
there may be more scope for a gis approach in the latter than in the former situations
the hohensemer scheme is not however beyond criticism
for example can hazards really be thought of as having any intentionality
industrial hazards and risk assessment
once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk
by risk we understand the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstances health and safety executive # #
it may of course be easier to quantify risk for natural hazards because of historical records and statistical estimation of recurrence intervals
technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare so that it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency
the identification of chemical hazards requires that the locations of sites be known together with the dangerous substances stored or processed there
in the uk see petts # for a splendid overview the health and safety executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances in excess of threshold limits are handled
such substances and thresholds include for instance # tonnes of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate and # tonnes of toxic chlorine gas
some # installations are notifiable along with thousands of kilometres of pipelines mostly high-pressure natural gas transmission lines
following a number of major accidents involving industrial activities including those at flixborough humberside in # beek the netherlands in # and seveso and manfredonia in italy in # the ec issued a directive on major accident hazards
the directive which is commonly referred to as the seveso directive was issued in june # and in the uk its requirements were embodied in the control of major accident hazard cimah regulations #
among other things these regulations require operators of hazardous installations to draw up on-site and off-site emergency plans and to give information to members of the public who live or work near such installations houston #
there are presently about # cimah sites
however many potentially hazardous chemical installations are not covered by such regulations
clearly a plant which stores # tonne less than is required for notification slips through the net while large numbers of handling sites warehouses for instance are not covered
the regulations have obvious implications for g#s work as illustrated below
in halton borough cheshire for instance there are # notifiable installations with over # # people living within the defined consultation zones petts #
it is also relevant to point out here the work of the health and safety executive in developing techniques for quantitative risk assessment health and safety executive #
such techniques include the use of a risk assessment tool riskat inputs to which include data on wind direction and speed the output of which is a map of calculated risk contours
in societal risk assessment it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation
this can be a difficult and time-consuming process and inevitably some simplifying assumptions are needed health and safety executive # #
again the g#s implications are clear and are discussed below
hazardous waste disposal
the disposal of both nuclear and non-nuclear wastes has proved to be of major public concern in recent years
the rather clumsy handling by nirex of the search for sites to store lowand intermediate-level wastes together with very recent worries about the import of toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are but two examples of such concern in the uk
however while the former has been given considerable attention by geographers summarized by openshaw # there has been relatively little such work in the uk on the disposal of non-nuclear wastes
this contrasts with the situation in the usa greenberg and anderson # where the clean-up of abandoned sites is a priority
certainly in terms of the volume of waste generated in the uk non-nuclear hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda while less than # million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in #�# # times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes openshaw # #
attention should be drawn to the three annual reports of the hazardous waste inspectorate now merged with other branches of the doe to form her majesty's inspectorate of pollution
these contain some valuable material on disposal practices and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority wra counties in england districts in wales scotland and northern ireland
each wra is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear
they too contain useful material on for instance the locations of sites though individual site licences must be consulted for details of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous wastes
what is not known is information on the locations of former sites at which quite toxic materials may have been dumped though recent work by egger # in austria has mapped a vast number of such sites
it is these rather than existing licensed sites which should be a focus of research activity particularly when examining possible links to ill health
we simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that people are almost certainly ill dead or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activities openshaw # #
research is in progress however to assess possible health effects of poor incineration diggle #
particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerators since these have been subject to crown immunity for many years and most are technically ill-equipped to burn at sufficiently high temperatures for adequate disposal of wastes gatrell and lovett #
we need to produce an inventory of all such sites together with a publicly available comprehensive database on all sites accepting hazardous industrial wastes
emergency planning
it is convenient to retain the nuclear non-nuclear distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning
nuclear emergency planning in the uk has been reviewed by matthews and pepper #
nuclear power stations must prepare a plan and submit this to the nuclear installations inspectorate and health and safety executive for approval
evacuation plans are required to cover an area within a distance of # km these detail the roles to be played by the emergency services
the very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the usa collins # where planning is required up to # km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes
local authorities in the uk that have declared themselves nuclear-free have been highly critical of british planning calling for an extension of emergency zones to at least # km
zeigler # should be consulted for material relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at three mile island
in the uk little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of releases of hazardous substances nor is much available on public attitudes to emergency planning
indeed no major studies of evacuation due to hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify
in the usa on the other hand a good deal of useful research in these areas has been undertaken
this research is brought together in very useful reports produced by the oak ridge national laboratory tennessee sorenson # vogt and sorenson # and the disaster research centre university of delaware
perry # has written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation covering both natural and technological hazards
for him comprehensive emergency planning and management involve prevention protection response and restoration
by prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipments for instance
included in protection are methods for detecting likely hazard events and in warning those likely to be affected
response includes search and rescue including the need to cope with secondary threats such as contamination of water supplies after an explosion or fire following an earthquake
as perry and others have noted relatively few resources are devoted to the first two aspects the bulk going to response and restoration rebuilding
it should be clear from this brief description that these issues are inherently geographical
in one of the few studies of evacuation behaviour after a non-nuclear hazard event liverman and wilson # give weight to this argument
in # a train carrying chlorine liquid petroleum toluene and propane was derailed in mississauga ontario causing a series of explosions
this led to the evacuation of # # people which although staggered over several days led to great pressure on transport arteries
an important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away rather than relying on the # official evacuation reception centres
despite this the evacuation was successful partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated
in addition the police were well prepared stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby toronto international airport than for the event in question
it is not without interest to note that in the usa there is a federal emergency management agency fema established in # charged with dealing with all types of emergency planning and management
in the uk there is no equivalent though the spate of disasters in the past # years involving over # lives lost has led to several calls for such a national body to be established 
natural hazards
in this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazards but only to highlight those aspects relevant to gis
needless to say the study of natural hazards is important a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazards account for up to # per cent of total deaths in the world each year mitchell #
in # for example more than # # people died in the cyclone and flooding of bangladesh and in # the hurricanes david and frederick caused more than #bn damage in the usa
shah # made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period #�# and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude measured in terms of lives lost are increasing
high death tolls are still a characteristic of less developed low-income countries
surprisingly fog is the third most important hazard in europe after floods and volcanoes
research on natural hazards has a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century
much of the impetus for such research arose in the usa from observations on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage
the vast majority of natural hazards studies have ignored the physical nature of the events and have concentrated on behavioural issues such as the perception and estimation of hazards
this emphasis is partly due to the background of the researchers involved many are human geographers and sociologists and partly because it is only really since the second world war that major hazards have been monitored systematically culminating of course in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology
brief reference to two examples of natural hazards may illustrate the potential relevance of a gis approach applications of which are considered below
jones # have examined the distribution of some # landslides in the uk
their maps show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the uk
more to the point however is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in terms of slopes rainfall rock types and so on
in other words the actual hazard distribution can be understood and areas at risk identified
the potential benefits to insurance companies engineers and planners are clear
second a well-known winter hazard in the uk with marked spatial localization is fog
predictive models of its distribution have clear implications for road and air safety
perry # describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography environmental features affecting fog formation and distance from standing water bodies
reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring stations often sparsely located and frequently outside fog-prone areas gis could implement a predictive model based on digitized map features and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation studies for airports and the like
the majority of natural hazard research has focused on single hazards but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type
this idea led hewitt and burton # to develop the concept of all-hazards-at-a-place
to achieve this they concentrated on the whole spectrum of damaging events in an area and explored their aggregate impact
the implications for gis in the development of hazardousness indices are obvious and if time-series data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability maps
the collection of historical data on natural hazards is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time
many areas that appear to be hazard-free on current maps may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence
this is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquakes
for example in # the whole of southern england was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now belgium a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted morse #
presumably the builders of the channel tunnel are aware of this
environmental epidemiology
this is of course a vast subject area embracing the impact of the natural and technological environments on human health
it covers for instance the associations between water and air pollution and ill health links between geological and pedological environments and ill health as well as associations between specific technological hazards eg high-voltage power lines and possible health effects
we can only consider a small fraction of this work here little consideration is given to occupational environments for instance
in the uk such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institutes at southampton and cardiff funded by the medical research council and others at the university of surrey robens institute and at the london school for hygiene and tropical medicine
the latter houses the small area health statistics research unit sahsru which has a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scales elliot #
the sahsru liaises closely with opcs
the kinds of databases used by these groups are discussed below
greenberg # and a collection of papers in greenberg # review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology
it seems worth stating at the outset that there are two ways geographical research in this general area can proceed
one is to collect morbidity and mortality data usually the latter is more widely available though the former more useful and to examine spatial distributions for clustering
this has itself generated a substantial literature see the papers in elliot # for an overview and is nowhere better exemplified than in openshaw's geographical analysis machine see ch #
we then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental associations
an alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis
if an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other areas to assess the hypothesis further
of course these two approaches are not clear-cut in practice in many cases the hypotheses of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping
one example of an hypothesis which has been given serious attention in recent years is the possible link between electromagnetic fields generated by high-voltage power lines or supply cables and ill health
some work perry # suggested associations with mental illness and suicide while others eg wertheimer and leeper # have examined links to various cancers including leukaemias
a good bibliography is provided in perry and pearl #
the central electricity generating board now privatized and split into two companies is funding a large-scale #-year project to assess links to childhood cancer while another recently announced study aims to look at links to sudden infant death
one obvious problem with implications for any gis input is that the effects are highly localized with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metres away from the route centre-lines
accuracy of digital data collection either of the power lines or residential locations is paramount
there seems to be a growing interest in examining associations between ill health and the geological environment
gis work in this field eg matthews # is reviewed later but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at imperial college responsible for a series of atlases on regional geochemistry and the existence of a society for environmental geochemistry and health
one area of recent debate concerns radon gas and its links to lung cancer
this is taken very seriously in the usa where the environmental protection agency estimates that # #�# # deaths from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure
estimates from scandinavia suggest that #�# per cent of such deaths are caused by exposure to radon richardson # #�#
the gas is trapped in well-insulated houses and is produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil thus it has been measured at high concentrations in parts of cornwall and devon
there are great difficulties in assessing health effects however since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhoods
carefully designed case-control studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors
other health concerns which might merit attention by those involved in the regional research laboratory rrl initiative include air and water pollution
the debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions is well known less publicity has been given to pahs polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons a product of combustion processes and known to be carcinogenic lioy and daisey #
research at the north west regional research laboratory nwrrl aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the cancer registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer
those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the warren springs laboratory containing details of smoke and sulphur dioxide emissions at a large number of sites in the uk
the possible link between nitrates in water and stomach cancer is the subject of much debate beresford # as is the association between aluminium content and alzheimer's disease
the problems of assessing such links are of course huge but there is scope for a contribution
the role of gis in hazard management scenarios examples
as we have already implied gis has a role to play in all aspects of hazard research from hazard monitoring risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating its consequences
the examples described below illustrate all these though as yet there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which gis has played a significant part
technological hazards emergency planning and gis
a considerable amount of research has been undertaken to apply gis methods to evacuation scenarios around hazardous sites
much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system
reference was made above to so-called cimah sites major hazardous installations for which on-site and off-site emergency plans must be prepared
early research at the nwrrl focused on developing a gis for use by the police and county emergency planning officers in cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in whitehaven west cumbria vincent # dunn #
the police required a portable system that could be implemented on an ibm-compatible microcomputer
this was written at the nwrrl using fortran # and the graphical kernel system
the gis is menu-based and is exceptionally user-friendly pl #
it opens with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zones used by the emergency planners
full zoom facilities are available at any stage
in any emergency it is of course vital to have high-quality data on the distribution of population and resources
the system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and non-domestic properties in the town together with digitized road centre-line data
both sets of data were provided by pinpoint analysis ltd who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country
other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of schools medical and transport services which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained
the gis permits population estimates to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map
most significantly it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which uses the road network to find optimal routes between user-defined start and end nodes
although predating the rrl initiative by several years and indeed the emergence of gis as a major research area we should remind ourselves of openshaw's work on appraising nuclear reactor sites
using what would now be called gis skills openshaw # examined over # # # km grid squares in the uk which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the # census which were made available for such grid squares
he demonstrated that there is an abundance of remote sites in contrast to the official view that such sites were increasingly hard to find
he suggested that in early spatial searches for sites only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous searches could not be performed by manual means with poor quality data openshaw # #
heywood and cornelius # have shown how gis can be used for monitoring possible radiation releases and thus the relevance of gis in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring
they propose a national radiological spatial information system and in a pilot project in cumbria have integrated several layers of data within arc info to show what this might involve fig #
such data include those from the population and agricultural censuses as well as point data from rain gauge sites and radiation monitoring stations
as an example the system is used to determine restriction zones for the movement of sheep after the explosion at chernobyl in #
this is done by finding areas of high rainfall and parishes with high sheep populations
the map overlay of point and area information shows generally good agreement with the restriction zones imposed by the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food with the exception of a small area to the south-east of cumbria bordering on lancashire 
the british government carried out a review of its arrangements for handling nuclear accidents overseas following the chernobyl accident
the doe through her majesty's inspectorate of pollution hmip was given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency hmso #
the monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network rimnet and has as its prime responsibility the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the uk of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident
the full implementation of the rimnet system will take some time
by the end of # gamma radiation dose monitors had been installed at # meteorological stations as part of phase # of the development programme
radiation readings are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analyses the data
the current criterion for alert is two readings of more than three times normal background either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent sites
the dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three levels the first is the normal system of press notices the second is the use of teletext and viewdata ceefax and prestel to get direct to members of the public at their homes or places of work the third is the use of telecom gold electronic mail to get more technical details to various official bodies such as water authorities jackson #
phase # of the rimnet scheme will be completed by the end of # when between # and # monitoring sites will have been established
given very wide regional and local variations in deposition questions must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network local authorities will need to supplement it with their own networks
there are important analytical problems to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later
abroad kaspar # has discussed a computer-based exercise with gis overtones involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in baden w�rttemberg
in the scenario he outlines an area affected by radioactive releases is determined the population within that area is allocated to reception areas with capacity constraints evacuation routes are identified and traffic restrictions implemented
little detail is provided however and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully
dangermond # describes the use of the arc info network module for use in emergency planning situations
he describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation districting and routeing algorithms
allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons in order to define specific areas of interest districts and to summarize their characteristics routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network the arcs of which can be assigned weights according to road conditions road capacity and so on
dangermond gives several examples in his paper including the use of network for the allocation of emergency vehicles optimum routeing of fire engines from garages to the accident scene and the movement of spills through sewers and river networks
when combined with the other facilities in arc info quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled
for example earthquake fault zones can be combined with data on housing density and structural details to predict earthquake damage levels and these data then related to the network model
vincent # illustrates the use of arc info and its network module for finding safe routes for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail systems of north-west england pl #
in this case population density data for a # km buffer on either side of network arcs were overlaid on the network itself so as to act as weights for the minimum path algorithm
chosen routes were those which minimized population rather than distance
hazardous waste disposal
there can be little doubt that a gis approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize rather than as conventionally maximize accessibility to a population
a particularly good application is to the search for potential sites for the disposal of nuclear and non-nuclear but none the less hazardous wastes
we discuss here some relevant work on the siting of facilities for the disposal of nuclear wastes before examining those for non-nuclear wastes
the major contribution to informed debate about the search for sites for the disposal of nuclear wastes has come from a group of geographers openshaw # and a gis approach to this problem can pay high dividends
the work of carver see openshaw # ch # is an interesting example
one advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation
conceptually what is offered is little more than an automated sieve mapping that land-use planners have used for many years but the whole procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using gis software
the authors examine both near-surface sites and deep repositories which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter
data layers include geological maps conservation areas transport routes petrochemical facilities and demographic data
as different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks pl # for instance when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository # per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to # per cent
however adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to # per cent and so on
we cannot pretend gis is a solution to the political problems of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedures goes some way towards satisfying a worried public 
gis research into site selection for non-nuclear hazardous waste has been almost exclusively conducted in north america and has yet to be matched in the uk
jensen and christiansen # working in the south-eastern usa use a raster approach with a pixel resolution of # m&sup# and boolean overlay to weed out particular sites such as those which are poorly drained environmentally sensitive or inaccessible see also stewart #
environmental monitoring of sites for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the usa
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla legislation of # superfund requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill sites of which some # had been identified by the environmental protection agency by # foresman #
a major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using gis to monitor this merchant # barringer # von braun #
this is an important topic since # per cent of rural households in the usa consume only groundwater while half the us population consumes at least some groundwater merchant #
clearly the research demands access to exceptionally good environmental data usually in three dimensions
as foresman # suggests we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role
merchant # for example use the image processing system erdas to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution this uses variables such as depth to water table soil type slope and so on see estes # for a similar approach
barringer # overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality hardness and corrosivity measures and build a linear model which shows that the background environmental variables are good predictors of the water quality indices
again a raster-based approach is used
a further example is work by von braun # who uses pmap to look at exposure of organic and metallic compounds in groundwater in the vicinity of tucson airport arizona
using plume models that predict the movement of contaminants she is able to intersect the results with data on current well locations and to assess which water supply areas are worst contaminated
overlaying the results with residential location data provides maps delineating location-specific exposures for each residence in each time-period von braun # #
in principle it is then possible to compare such doses with epidemiological data once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcomes
attention should be drawn to foresman's comment that the us geological survey usgs at the eros data centre have successfully linked arc info to a model of groundwater flow foresman # #
this kind of link between gis and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the nwrrl in linking gis and air pollution plume models 
natural hazards and disaster management
several studies in recent papers have shown the effectiveness of gis in mitigating the effects of major natural hazards
berke and ruch # for example describe a gis for assessing the impacts of hurricanes on the texas gulf coast
hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the usa
it has been estimated for example that during the mid # some # million us citizens were subject to hurricane winds of over # km h and # million were subject to hurricane surge brinkman #
the system described by berke and ruch # is raster-based and has an interesting modelling component called slosh sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes
slosh is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensities angles of approach to the shoreline forward movement speeds and landfall locations
additional algorithms are used to model total building damage costs for each grid cell based on water-depth and speed-depth rating curves
hobeika and jamei # describe the massevacuation massvac simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area
the system comprises three interrelated modules community and disaster type characteristics module population distribution module network evacuation module
the type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network has to be evacuated
the control and management strategies are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario
massvac is quite flexible and various user-defined road network options are available such as traffic signal timings on the road network one-way traffic reserved lanes for special vehicles such as those of the emergency services
hobeika and jamei have tested massvac on various evacuation scenarios for virginia beach city in order to determine evacuation times for flood and hurricane conditions
in general they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation times
southworth # have enhanced the massvac model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call mvopl
this module has been developed using ibm's graphics kernel system and provides a number of display screens
the most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram and evacuation shelter capacities as bar diagrams
the diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation
in dry parts of the world such as australia forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which gis might help examine their potential impacts
kessell # describes a pc-based gis called preplan pristine environment planning language which is a natural area management land-use planning and fire modelling system developed for the australian national parks and wildlife service preplan comprises four modules a simple raster-based gis a grid cell resource database a wide range of vegetation fuel fire behaviour erosion and land-use models tabular statistical and colour graphics output system
with this system real-time fire growth can be modelled taking into account changes in terrain fuel and temporal changes in the weather
kessell points out that uncontrollable fires are recurrent phenomena in many parts of australia causing damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars and significant loss of life
systems such as preplan can provide the user with sound models of the behaviour patterns of fire and are therefore of enormous value in land-use planning
one of the most widespread natural hazards is flooding and the potential for loss of property risk to life and general social disruption is large
one interesting example of a gis approach to flood damage estimation is the anuflood package which was developed in the early # following detailed flood damage studies for flood-prone coastal towns in northern new south wales australia smith and greenaway #
the anuflood system requires locational and building type data on individual properties stage-damage curves relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depths for each property type and lastly flood frequency in terms of flood height expressed as a probability
output from the system is both tabular and graphical
of particular interest is the construction of maps showing the expected annual amounts of damage for gridded flood-prone areas
anuflood also contains modules which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation options such as property height raising levee construction and flood proofing
environmental epidemiology
the possibilities sketched above relate to emergency planning the search for hazardous sites and risk assessment
to what extent can gis help if an event occurs
what for instance of the health consequences
there is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for gis applications is wide gatrell #
for instance diggle # assess the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a now-closed incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point processes to test this
this would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data increasingly available from sources such as cancer registries to ordnance survey os grid references
such a link is provided by the central postcode directory which matches all # million unit postcodes in the uk to grid references
when the cases of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer the hypothesis is given strong support
although the proposed method is novel it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model clusters of disease see for example cuzick and edwards #
the work of diggle # examined only a single point source though it generalizes to multiple sources and to linear hazards as well
as a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by cross # on childhood leukaemia
there are numerous hypotheses concerning the aetiology of this disease from ionizing radiation to viral transmission and cross's approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypotheses and to use arc info to display and analyse results
for instance one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission lines as noted earlier
if these are digitized and buffer zones constructed around them fig # we can quite easily test hypotheses about prevalence in such buffer zones as compared with prevalence outside
however we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data since such electromagnetic effects have a very weak effect beyond perhaps # m wertheimer and leeper # 
there has been a suspicion for many years that high rates of stomach cancer in parts of wales may be linked to soil chemistry specifically such factors as zinc copper ratios and to lead content in water supplies
matthews # has used data from the regional cancer registry morbidity rather than mortality data and data on trace elements to examine this link
since the latter are available for a # km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the os grid reference
as with any such study there are the usual problems of ecological analysis and influences of migration together with issues of separating out the risk factors under investigation from possible confounding factors
in the usa morrill's report on the beginnings of a #m study into the possible radiation doses received as result of radiation releases by the hanford washington state nuclear complex would seem to cry out for gis skills to be applied morrill #
the research project will employ plume dispersion models in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic records
to some extent this line of approach was anticipated by johnson # in his study of exposure to plutonium fall-out from the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant near denver see zeigler # #�#
using soil samples he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancers in various distance bands detecting a marked distance decay effect
research problems and prospects
the work reviewed above suggests that the application of gis techniques to hazard assessment emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problems
undoubtedly the giss of the # will look very different from their rather primitive ancestors
computer power is becoming cheaper digital data more readily available and giss are becoming hybrid systems involving other technologies
in this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them
doubtless there are many others such is the surge of interest in gis technology
data availability
we should first consider the availability and quality of data concerning the populations who may be at risk from the storage and transport of hazardous substances from toxic air pollution from flooding and so on
such data are crucial either for assisting the emergency services to make assessments about resources they need to deploy in such events or for high estimates to be made of risk
within the public domain in the uk we must rely in general on data from the most recent population census the lowest level being that for enumeration districts eds
as is well known rhind # these contain on average perhaps #�# households and #�# people
the boundaries eds have not been widely digitized unlike the higher level electoral wards
however the centroids of eds are available as # m grid references and artificial ed polygons can be created if necessary
in some instances such data will suffice in many cases they will have to suffice as nothing better is available
but in some areas eds are very extensive physical units and the shapes will be quite distorted
furthermore the scales at which population estimates are often required means that even eds are too coarse for risk assessments 
for instance in performing its quantitative risk assessments the health and safety executive will rarely deal with distances from hazardous sites in excess of # km petts # and census data will not offer sufficient resolution for accurate population estimates to be made 
it should be pointed out however that the national radiological protection board currently uses # km grid square resolution population data from the # census in its radiological protection studies hallam #
it would seem that despite the costs involved they should consider investing in the very detailed digital data pinpoint address code pac provided by pinpoint analysis ltd
this area of application would appear to be an obvious market for such a product
a useful research exercise would be to compare the use of census and pac data in deriving quantitative risk assessments and this is an interesting research problem
even with pac data some assumptions would need to be made about numbers of persons per household if good population estimates were to be made 
more generally we need to consider the availability of large databases for hazard studies and emergency planning and this is an area ripe for major initiatives
in the uk we seem to be lagging well behind the usa in the construction of databases on hazardous sites and especially hazard events such as those involving toxic releases 
for instance lioy and daisey # in their work on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in new jersey construct a microinventory for each of three towns comprising the locations of chemical plants metal processing plants paint spray manufacturers and so on
some attribute information is available for these 
more closely linked to gis is work by mcmaster and johnson # who perform a very detailed inventory of hazardous materials both stored and transported in santa monica california
although the raster displays are very crude it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people for instance particular age groups within certain distances of toxic hazard sites
we have data on some hazardous sites eg those regulated by cimah in the uk but a much more comprehensive approach should be adopted especially if we are serious in the search for environmental associations with chronic diseases
the same is true for toxic releases 
in the usa the environmental protection agency produces an acute hazards events database while the department of transportation has a database recording details of # # releases of toxic materials such details include locational information type and amount of material released mode of release and resulting injuries or deaths cutter and solecki #
can we not use gis technology to construct risk mosaics zeigler # at a variety of spatial scales akin to hewitt and burton's hazardousness of a place
in the uk only a handful of county emergency planning departments cumbria for instance have built up resource databases in digital form and this needs to be promoted
further afield we need to recognize that some disasters most obviously chernobyl will have implications for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take place with some kind of international co-ordination 
there will also be movements of hazardous cargoes across frontiers and there are clearly problems of risk assessment and planning for emergencies at or near international boundaries or at sea and airports
as noted above the work of fedra # is a major step in this direction and links need to be forged between initiatives in the uk and the rest of europe
in terms of databases on hazardous wastes attention has already been drawn to the waste disposal plans prepared bywras
these give details of present site locations and some indication of permitted wastes though little or no information on closed and abandoned sites
however for details of disposal the individual site licences must be consulted 
the former hazardous waste inspectorate operated a large database on all sites with details of permitted wastes including allowable quantities
the database was created by a commercial company aspinwalls ltd
there are numerous potentially usable databases for environmental epidemiological work
opcs of course is a major data repository for medical statistics and their various monitor series are of use though only at the scale of district health authority and above see gatrell and lovett # for an example
regional health authorities will from time to time produce mortality data at ward level 
however if cancers are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain data from regional cancer registries these data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more valuable 
the data are postcoded and may have some occupational details
for example we have received data from the regional cancer registry in manchester comprising all cancers of the larynx and lung notified between # and #
this large data set to which grid references have now been added comprises information about nearly # # individuals
it has now been copied into ingres a relational database management system permitting queries to be made about subsets of the data for instance all males between the ages of # and # suffering from laryngeal cancer
other data sources on cancers are independent registries of malignancies
an example is that on leukaemias managed by the leukaemia research fund centre in leeds alexander #
it should be noted that there are frequently major discrepancies between the regional registries and the specialist registries partly because the latter receive notifications directly from consultants
indeed working directly with consultants proves invaluable in gaining access to high morbidity data
two other potential sources of data are worth mentioning 
first attention should be drawn to the new directive from the department of health to regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population
this means in practice that district medical officers are charged with preparing an annual report presenting and interpreting epidemiological data identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes
lancaster university is already heavily involved in the work of preston district health authority in this area
second family health service authorities fhsas are also required to take on these roles but from the viewpoint of primary health care services
fhsas which correspond to non-metropolitan counties and to metropolitan boroughs hold large databases on services provided by general practitioners for instance uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancers
is it we wonder possible to contemplate bringing together some of these data sources to form a national online health information system nohis to parallel that for employment and unemployment townsend #
this might include data on morbidity and mortality uptake of preventative medicine service useand availability at both primary and hospital level 
it would be a useful management tool particularly in view of the reorganizationtaking place in the national health service
it should not be forgotten that hazards themselves have geographical distributions yet there has been little effort in the uk to develop public domain databases
are there hazard-prone areas
is there a regional differentiation in hazard type
these are of course commercially important questions and a good deal of money is going into the collection of such data by insurance companies
one well known database is major hazard incident data service mhidas global industrial hazards database which is currently being developed bythe safety and reliability directorate on behalf of the major hazards assessment unit of the uk health and safety directorate
this system currently runs in dbase ii and contains in excess of # items of professionally assessed information on major hazards coded into some # separate fields 
unfortunately the spatial referencing is poor and with some effort this could easily be remedied
it is for example little usewhen recording a chemical spill into an egyptian river to have entered into the appropriate field the nile after all this river is some # km long
here in our view is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input rendering the data of limited value 
in some cases good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found their way into a gis
a case in point is inland and coastal flooding
most river authorities have detailed maps showing the geographical limits of floods in relation to their return periods
within the next decade as the privatized water companies develop their gis we shall see a massive amount of data conversion in this area 
this development together with the availability of digital terrain models will allow quite sophisticated flood forecasting models to be developed within a gis framework 
as sea-levels rise in the next #�# years due to the greenhouse effect this very practical use of gis technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance 
spatial statistics
another way in which there needs to be a between statistical methods and gis is in the area of spatial sampling and estimation from spatial samples 
this is clearly an important issue in radiation monitoring as the discussion of rimnet above implies 
as an example peirson # has reviewed the evidence on artificial radioactivity in cumbria and shows maps of the distribution of certain radionuclides as contoured surfaces
the point worth making here is that there are many alternative schemes for interpolating from irregular point data lam #
one method in particular kriging now available as part of the uniras software offers not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map
where this is high it suggests that an additional sampling station might be set up
such techniques are now standard in environmental science see streit # for an application to rainfall monitoring and need to be promoted vigorously in hazard studies estes #
related to this problem is that of making population estimates for new zones that result from overlay operations 
we may want to count numbers living within plumes circles of fixed radius buffer zones and so on
existing gis techniques usually base the estimates on area-weighted shares so that a new polygon created by slicing an existing area in half is assigned half the population of that source unit
this may be quite absurd in some cases notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ed
at the nwrrl work is under way flowerdew and green # to solve such problems using the em algorithm and the statistical modelling package glim which has been interfaced with arc info
operations research methods and simulation
while there is some research activity in linking statistical models to gis there would seem to be scope for further applications of operations research techniques to gis problems
within some sophisticated gis such as arc info there are some useful algorithms such as shortest path calculations but gis developers have in general failed to realize the natural links between gis functions and many operations research techniques
over the last # years or so a large theoretical literature has been developed to provide tools for the solution of many problems associated with emergency planning kolesar #
one important class of problems is the selection of locations for the emergency service units
the choice of locations need not be for permanent bases but can also include dynamic repositioning of units as circumstances dictate kolesar and walker #
in any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment of resources to demands
if resources are held at one set of locations and the demands are at another and the costs of transportation are known how do we allocate the resources most efficiently
in a major emergency for example there might be a need to supply blood products held at regional blood banks to hospitals
this of course is the classic transportation problem and its solution is well known
as far as we know the microcomputer-based emergency response system devised by belardo # is the only gis-like software to incorporate this algorithm
in this system the solution to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network which is displayed on the computer screen
as a last example of the potential role of operations research in gis and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problems that faced the peel regional police force during the mississauga evacuation mentioned previously scanlon and padgham #
during the early states of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing the police was the street-by-street warning of the population to make ready for evacuation
speed was of the essence and manpower was limited
here then is a familiar operations research network problem all roads have to be traversed such that the journey length time is a minimum
this is the chinese postman problem which provides a hamiltonian circuit through the arcs as compared with the travelling salesman problem which is a minimum route through the network nodes 
chapter nine
i have a very important assignment for you paula arlene frampton-cox said
she inserted a du maurier cigarette into her long tortoiseshell holder and sat back looking at paula who was seated in the visitor's chair on the other side of the desk long legs crossed elegantly
paula looked every inch a model these days arlene thought with a touch of proprietorial pride
her long hair shining gold was swept back and caught at the nape of her neck with a bow make-up expertly applied accentuated the classically beautiful lines of her face and she wore her well-cut suit with all the panache that was expected of her
a good suit was a working model's uniform paula now bought two each season and wore them with perfectly matching accessories hat bag and shoes
this one was in soft light green with a boxy jacket and narrow skirt and the same green-and-white check material of the little sleeveless blouse had been used to line the jacket and face the wide reveres
paula's bag and shoes were patent black leather her gloves white and she carried a long walking umbrella neatly furled in its fur-trimmed case
perfectly groomed from head to toe and with all that assurance she was ready to take on the world arlene thought with satisfaction for she looked on paula her very own creation 
the raw materials might have been there before indeed hadn't it been she arlene who had spotted them
but the transformation of a leggy young filly into a sleekly beautiful racehorse had been her doing
eighteen months on the model circuit had eliminated all trace of her former somerset accent
she had listened to arlene's own voice and set about imitating it for she held her mentor in the highest esteem whilst still being a little afraid of her
the house of mattli is expanding from couture into ready-to-wear and one of the big bristol stores taylors are putting on a show to publicise the fact that they will be stocking the new' arlene explained
i have been asked to supply the models and i would like you to be one of them 
mattli
paula repeated impressed
the house of mattli was a husband and wife team who were numbered amongst the top ten names in the incorporated society of london fashion designers
furthermore madame mattli was a frenchwoman an accident of birth which added to her glamour for was not paris the fashion capital of the world
madame mattli will be coming to bristol herself arlene continued
taylors have a certain amount of stock but she will be bringing extra samples from london especially for the show
i only want the best of my girls on this job
madame mattli remember is used to the best
we can't afford any sloppiness
i can count on you paula i feel sure
oh yes paula said brimming with suppressed excitement
you can count on me
madame mattli was almost exactly as paula had imagined she would be a petite perfectly turned out woman with an air of chic that was unmistakably french
her dark grey-streaked hair which she wore in a long bob had been cut by vidal sassoon and she wore a beautifully tailored black suit relieved only by a little white flounce at the neckline
in the fitting rooms at taylors she fussed and fretted over her creations a mother hen and though paula was overawed by the great designer she also liked her on sight
madame mattli might be a stickler for detail with a generous helping of the artistic temperament which kept her tight-coiled a spring and which would explode into frenzy if the smallest detail was not as it should be but she also had a kind face and deep perceptive eyes
half way through the day's programme of shows while the dressers went off to grab a sandwich and the model girls who would not dare to eat while they were showing revived themselves with cups of black coffee madame mattli took paula to one side
little one i would like to speak with you
paula's stomach turned a somersault 
had she done something wrong
i have been watching you work madame mattli said directly 
her accent reminded paula of louise perhaps that was why she warmed to her in spite of the fact that she was so awe-inspiring
you are exactly right for a couture model 
you have all the physical attributes 
thank you paula said faintly
madame mattli waved a dismissive hand
do not thank me
i am not saying this to make your head swell 
on the contrary
the fact is that i have a vacancy arising for a couture model 
i believe you are exactly what i am looking for
i would like you to come to london to work for me
over madame mattli's shoulder paula could see arlene watching her a tiny smile lifting one corner of her scarlet mouth and paula knew her well enough by now to know exactly what she was thinking
she did not want to lose paula who was one of her best models but already she was enjoying the reflected glory that came from having personally trained a house model for one of the great london couture houses
she had known about the vacancy at mattli and hoped that the job might be offered to paula
it was the seal of approval for her own judgement
well
madame mattli demanded
can i have a little time to think it over
paula asked boldly
a little
but please do not delay too long
my present house model leaves at the end of the month and there are plenty of girls who would jump at the chance
i'm sure
but all the same i couldn't make such a move without giving it some thought paula said grandly
but inside she was bubbling with excitement
time to think
she didn't need a single second
the moment madame mattli had offered her the job she had made up her mind
she was going to take it of course
a month later paula smartly dressed in a new tweed suit with the obligatory matching bag and shoes and lugging both her modelling case and a brand new cream leather suitcase took the train to london to begin her new career
she had booked herself a bed at a ywca hostel for the time being
it was not quite what she envisaged for herself but it had the advantage of being cheap and it went some way towards satisfying grace who was convinced that london was a den of iniquity waiting to swallow up her unsuspecting daughter
from the hostel it was only a short tube ride to south audley street where madame mattli had her showrooms yet another advantage paula thought trying to weigh up the points in favour of the hostel which she hated on sight
sharing a small spartan room with two other girls northerners whose accent paula found almost incomprehensible and with whom she had nothing in common making breakfast in the communal kitchen queuing for the bath adhering to a strict curfew after which time the doors were locked and bolted none of these were restrictions paula had the slightest intention of enduring for long
but for now it would have to do
and at least she was in london centre of the british fashion industry 
as for the house of mattli it might have been in a different world to the hostel with its air of being a cross between a workhouse and a boarding school 
the first time she rang the bell and went in through the front doors of the elegant old house where the showrooms were situated mattli had no rear entrance paula felt she was stepping into the place of her dreams 
deep carpet covered the floors and the stairs swept up to the showrooms and the warren of workrooms beyond and though the window drapes and furnishings were ever-so-slightly faded as if they had seen better days they were of the finest silks and velvets and every corner was swept polished and cleaned daily so that no single speck of dust let alone a cobweb dared show itself
the showroom was neither large nor small decorated in muted shades of aubergine which would not detract from the clothes
there was a low table and three or four dainty chairs with aubergine velvet seats and gilded spindle legs 
the crystal chandelier was for effect only lighting that would show off the clothes to their best advantage was brilliant yet discreet and along one wall were racks holding some of the ready-to-wear garments
in contrast to this elegant frontage the workrooms beyond were a hive of frenzied activity
pattern cutters fitters sewing hands and their assistants all worked at an incredible speed
this paula soon discovered was the way of the fashion world a constant frantic rush against the clock to have collections ready on time or to complete individual couture garments for customers who always considered their order more urgent more important than that of anyone else
paula was amazed by the security arrangements that were necessary to ensure that the new season's collections remained exclusive the windows at the rear of the premises were heavily barred and practically the first thing she had to do on commencing her employment was to sign a contract promising that she would not breathe a word about the designs she saw 
on her second day madame mattli took her to vidal sassoon's salon in grosvenor house so that her hair could be cut in an up-to-the-minute style
unlike some couturiers madame did not mind if her model girls did not have the same colour hair but she did insist on identical styles
by the time vidal sassoon had finished with her paula's long fair locks had been shorn to a sharp geometric shape and she scarcely recognised the reflection that looked back at her from the mirror
among the rich and famous who had come to the salon to have their hair cut tinted and set paula recognised dusty springfield the pop singer her eyes big and sooty her lips pearly pink and was unable to suppress the thrill of excitement which ran through her
this was her very first taste of only the best being good enough and she liked it
it was paula's job to show samples parading slowly up and down in front of the clients as they sat on the elegant spindle-leg chairs taking in every detail of the garments with a critical and practised eye
sometimes they came alone sometimes with a man in tow to foot the bill 
paula guessed
the appearance of a famous face in the show rooms always caused a stir amongst the girls who all longed to hook a wealthy husband and if he had a title like the aly khan or was a film star like omar shariff then so much the better
not everything that paula had to do was quite so glamorous however
in the long hours when there were no customers to show she was expected to lend a hand with some of the unskilled tasks running errands and making tea unpicking a seam or a hem even sewing on a button or a hook and eye when she had been taught the proper way to do it
paula was not very clever with her needle but she soon learned to be careful so as not to incur the wrath of the seamstress
there were new tricks of modelling to be learned too how to remove a coat sliding it carefully off her shoulders with the sleeves hanging in perfect balance never for one moment allowing the inside to be on view for samples were often unlined
this trick took hours of practice up and down the landing at the hostel while the other girls looked at her she had taken leave of her senses 
although she enjoyed her job paula was lonely
even the most popular of girls soon discovered that in this highly competitive world where models vied with one another for the most glamorous jobs and the wealthiest and best-looking men there was far more bitchiness than in the provinces and paula was far from popular
the other girls disliked her for her outstanding looks and her haughty ways and made no attempt to be friendly on anything but the most superficial level and the pattern cutters and sewing hands hurried home to their families and boyfriends the moment they finished their long day's work
paula spent most of her free time alone window shopping visiting news theatres where she sometimes watched the programme of cartoons twice round and drinking endless cups of espresso coffee in caf�s and coffee houses
her favourite was the coffee shop in fenwicks in bond street for this was the haunt and the meeting place of all those from the world of fashion
one lunchtime when she had been at the house of mattli for a few months paula went there for her usual coffee and the cottage cheese salad that was her staple diet now that it was so important that she did not add a single half-inch to her wand- figure
she took her tray to the pay desk opened her bag and felt for her purse
it was not there
frantically she rooted round then checked her pockets without success
i'm sorry
i seem to have lost my purse she explained
the girl behind the till stared at her stonily
paula was going hot and cold by now
had it been stolen
no she remembered her bag tipping over in the cloakroom at mattli it must have fallen out then
but without it she could not pay for her coffee and salad
having trouble a voice beside her asked 
don't worry 
let me
paula turned gratefully then gasped with surprise as she recognised the slight figure in black roll-neck sweater and skin tight pants
i don't believe it
gary oliver
what are you doing here
the same as you i expect paula getting my strength up to face the rest of the day
let me pay and then we'll have lunch together and do some catching up unless you're meeting someone of course
no no i'm not
paula picked up her try and moved aside waiting for him flushed with pleasure at seeing a familiar face
gary oliver was a designer young and very talented
she had met him back home in the west country when he had come to supervise a show put on by one of the big ready-to-wear labels carnega for whom he worked as a junior member of the design team
for a whole week they had worked closely together sharing flasks of coffee and packets of cigarettes and paula had grown to like the pixie little man who by his very nature offered her no challenge and no threat 
gary should have been a girl she had thought for he was half a head smaller than she was with fair curling hair baby-blue eyes and long thick lashes that were the envy of every woman who met him
shall we sit over there in the corner
gary suggested
he led the way his slim hips in the tight fitting pants snaking gracefully between the tables
they unloaded their trays on to a table
what are you doing in london then paula
apart from mislaying your purse i mean
he grinned at her impishly
she told him
and what about you
aren't you with carnega any more
he shook his head
dimples played in his cheeks
no now i'm with the house of oliver
the house of oliver
oh she squealed as light dawned 
your house 
you've set up as a designer in your own right gary
yep
in a small way at the moment of course but things are happening
i came into a bit of money when my grandmother died and i decided to put it to good use
isn't it a bit of a risk
paula asked
he shrugged his narrow shoulders
perhaps
but i wanted to work for myself
designing clothes for carnega was all very well and i made a good living at it i won't deny but i wanted to be free to do my own thing and to have my own name on the labels
i have quite a few contacts people who knew me when i was designing for carnega and they have been very encouraging
so i have decided to move to london and open a showroom
in fact i have just been looking at a place in south audley street not far from mattli
if it worksoutwe shall practically be neighbours paula
what a small world
i had no idea paula said surprised she had not already heard the news
usually the slightest whisper travelled jungle drums through the world of fashion
until now gary had been an out-of-town designer of course
but if he was moving to london his new fashion house would soon be a talking point
we must keep in touch gary said as he finished his cheese roll
promise you'll look in and say hello when you have time
i will
apart from anything else i owe you a coffee
true
i don't suppose i could persuade you to work for me in return 
i'm looking for a couple of good models 
though i don't suppose i could afford to pay you as well as mattli does yet
maybe one day
paula laughed
i don't earn that much
by the time i've paid for my room at the ywca and bought all the make-up and clothes i need there never seems to be anything left over 
i'm looking for a rich husband to take me away from it all
and i'm sure one day you'll find him
in the meantime don't forget your friends eh paula
i won't she promised glancing at her watch
oh hell i shall have to go
me too
but it was great to see you again paula
they walked back to south audley street together weaving their way through the lunchtime crowds on the pavements the tall striking girl and the young man whose pixie looks belied his twenty-six years
outside the front entrance of the house of mattli paula turned to give him a quick impulsive hug
thanks for the lunch gary
and good luck with your new venture
she held up her fingers tightly crossed for him
he grinned
i'll need it
don't forget to come and see me will you
i shall be expecting you
i won't forget
'bye for now she called and ran in through the imposing front door
madame mattli was furious
in all the time she had been with her paula had never seen her so angry
i hear you have been seen going into the house of oliver she said her immaculately painted lips tight with fury
beside her monsieur mattli a small greek-looking man some ten years her senior was also quivering with indignation
not once but several times he added 
it was so unusual for him to contribute anything to the conversation that paula glanced at him in surprise
though he was always in evidence it was invariably madame who did all the talking giving orders fussing around clients so that paula was never quite certain what his role was
gary oliver is a friend she said defensively 
madame mattli snorted angrily
i do not pay you to have friends in rival fashion houses 
he's not a rival
paula broke off 
it seemed ridiculous that a newcomer like gary could be any threat to a well-established house like mattli
but in the cut-throat world of fashion up and coming designers were to be feared and already gary's reputation was growing 
you know that we insist on complete loyalty madame mattli continued
the security of our designs is paramount
oh paula how could you
but i would never mention anything i have seen here
paula protested
madame snorted again
how can i be sure of that 
even if you do not intend to be disloyal there is always the risk that you might be careless
pillow talk is the most dangerous
pillow talk
paula repeated stunned 
close though her friendship with gary had become she had never once breathed a word to him about the new collections she saw taking shape at mattli and as for pillow talk the notion was absurd
there was nothing like that between them and never would be
gary was not interested in girls
surely that must be obvious to everyone who met him
you must stop visiting him madame said firmly 
either i have your word on it or i am afraid you can no longer remain in my employ
i want you to promise me here and now that you will not see gary oliver again
paula was trembling
her job with the house of mattli was her life 
but to allow herself to be dictated to in this way when she knew she had done nothing wrong was tantamount to admitting guilt
and she couldn't bear the thought of being sucked back into the ebb tide of loneliness again either
with gary she enjoyed a relationship she had never experienced with anyone else the easy-going friendship of a male who made no demands whatever on her and it meant more to her than she had realised
i have never betrayed any confidence and i never will
but you can't expect me to cut myself off from my friends she said
i am afraid i do expect it paula in this case
i can't promise not to see gary again
very well
there was a hint of sadness now in madame's eyes but her mouth was set and determined 
i shall be sorry to lose you paula
you are a good model and you suited me very well
but you leave me no choice
please do not bother to come in again
i shall contact the agency for a replacement immediately 
and i warn you if any of my designs or anything like them turn up in the showroom at the house of oliver i shall sue and win the sort of damages that will put your little friend out of business for good
do i make myself clear 
paula was still afraid of madame mattli and she was also close to tears
but she was determined madame should not be aware of either
yes madame
i'm sorry to leave you but i assure you you need not worry on that score 
the showrooms of the house of oliver were smaller and less grand than those at the house of mattli but the d�cor was newer and fresher pale grey drapes ultra modern black furniture and a great deal of gleaming stainless steel
gary was in the workroom when paula arrived pinning a length of vibrant pink chiffon sarong-style around one of his models 
his mouth was full of pins
what are you doing here he asked without moving his lips
paula perched herself against the cutting table trying to look nonchalant
i've left mattli she said
gary stared at her for a moment pins spewing from his mouth and catching on the front of his black jersey
then he unpinned the length of chiffon and let it fall to the floor
the model stood motionless clad in nothing but her bra and stockings waiting for his instructions
we'll leave this for now claudia he said
see if you can rustle up a cup of tea for paula and me please
the girl pulled on her wrap and moved to the door looking back over her shoulder as she went and paula was aware of the hostility in her gaze
why was it all women hated her so even when they didn't know her
she shrugged
oh well she should be used to it by now
gary got up took paula by the arm and led her over to the low sofa
what's all this about lovey
you can't have left mattli
i have
paula related what had happened and saw gary turn pale
oh lord
you mean she thinks you've been spying for me
if she sues i'll be ruined 
even worse someone of her stature could make a hell of a lot of trouble for me even if she doesn't
but gary i haven't been spying for you
i haven't even mentioned a single detail of the mattli collection
you know that and so do i but suppose i've done something similar
it happens every season by sheer chance and law of averages some of the ideas are bound to come up 
there are always accusations of piracy and copy-catting though they can't usually be substantiated
but if she can prove that you and i
that's nonsense
we haven't done anything wrong
gary ran a distracted hand through his mop of fair hair
you're going to have to describe the mattli collection to me
every detail
gary she objected shocked 
you're an original 
you can't steal their ideas
no idiot not so that i can steal them
so that i can go through my designs and make quite certain that there is not one collar not one cuff detail not the slightest influence that they could accuse me of copying from them
oh jesus christ suppose there's something major
my peg topevening gown my beautiful cerise lace i could end up having to rethink the whole collection
for goodness sake stop panicking
paula said though she could feel the seeds of panic herself
i'm sure there's nothing to worry about 
i only hope you're right he said in anguished tones
the model came in with the cups of tea still glowering darkly at paula from beneath her fringe of false eyelashes
it was clear she was blaming paula bitterly for the interrupted afternoon and her boss's drastic change of mood
that girl is a dog 
paula said when they were alone again
i'm sure she can't do justice to your designs 
and with a miserable face like hers i'm surprised you ever get any work done at all
gary looked crestfallen
she's the best i could get
oh what rubbish 
paula said roundly
anyway you've got me now so you can get rid of her
what do you mean
gary asked
he looked like a worried small boy
i told you i've left mattli
i'll come and work for you
oh paula
gary's expression became even more anxious
you know i'd give my right arm to have someone as good as you to model for me
but i told you before i couldn't afford to pay you what you're worth
well not for ages anyway
it's going to be a long struggle getting established and until i am i don't see how
paula smiled
for the first time she felt the stirrings of something like power 
it was not unlike the feeling she experienced when men looked at her and wanted her though she knew it could not be that for there was nothing sexual between her and gary and never would be
but it was just as exciting nevertheless
it made her feel strong invincible almost and just a tiny bit she had drunk too much wine 
her smile spread 
grant's remains were shovelled into a canvas bag
tense facing outwards forster lawton and nell guarded delaney as he intoned the seaman's prayer of interment and then committed the canvas bag to the ocean
the storm was abating rapidly the evening sky clearing in the west with the golden rays of the setting sun adding a dying colour to the sullen slate blue water
the whiteness of the canvas body-bag dimmed beneath the onrushing sea faded at the edges then grew smaller greener and was gone 
they returned to the bridge fearful of every dark place every corner every door
the gangway lamps seemed to give no light only add further to the gloom of the dusk
back in the wheelhouse delaney faced them
right
you all know the score 
as i see it we've got two choices
one we get out of here now
launch the lifeboat take our chances or two we go after whatever it is
nobody spoke immediately
finally forster glanced at lawton for support and drawled laconically
i'm not leaving here until we've done for that bastard 
it's personal from now on in 
lawton nodded his agreement
yes he said i feel the same
nell
delaney asked looking at her squarely
i agree she said without hesitation
their tense edgy faces watched delaney closely 
we don't know what we're up against delaney said so let's proceed with maximum caution 
trouble is lawton said with a frown there aren't enough of us to search the ship
it can work its way past us and hide again
we could still be looking for it when they blow us out of the water
that's why we've got to take risks nell put in 
lure it into a trap somehow
and quickly
forster's chuckle was mirthless
i don't think this joker is going to need much encouragement
no
delaney was momentarily thoughtful
what had you in mind nell
she pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner and the cylinders of oxygen in the back pack lying beside it
two of our number have been killed
each time when they were on their own
let's give it the same conditions only this time we use as the bait 
they looked at the man forster had found
it was a safety suit an advanced model of the nbc type with its own oxygen tanks
one in ambush with the rest of us acting beaters 
start at one end of the ship making as much noise as possible
forster grunted
it had no trouble finding grant
i think it's a good idea
and i'll go in the suit until we reach the ambush point 
might help to draw it
they helped him kit up nell connecting the leads from the back pack into the suit attachments
forster's breathing whistled out of the one-way valve
behind the clear wide vizor he tried to smile
cosy in here he joked
even got my own toilet
bloody handy in the circumstances
delaney took the lead
it was now light the lamps on the gangway giving murky yellow pools that barely pushed back the inky blackness of a starless night
at the entrance to the laboratory complex the others drew on their own masks
ineffectual or not against lingering gases it seemed a wise precaution even if it was only psychological
delaney glanced back at them
let's make sure it knows where we are
they made noise slammed doors
nell shuddered
were unseen eyes watching them
was it even now shadowing them moving soundlessly from cover to cover a tiger in the steel jungle 
forster's radio-projected voice broke into her thoughts
looks a good place
he was at the entrance to the secure lab zone 
this must be the only way in nell said
forster was quickly de-suited
as they set up the now empty suit with its back to the door half slumped over a control panel he settled down behind the curtained entrance of the showers
delaney's voice was hushed
maybe we should leave two of us here
don't want to rouse any suspicions
forster was adamant
after all it might be able to count
when he didn't get any response he patted the uzi beside him on the steel floor
i won't be unprepared like poor old grant
delaney pulled the curtain across covering forster who cut a small slit in the opaque green plastic widening it to give himself a better field of view
lawton came and crouched down in front of it
i've left the suit's radio on full he said
make it sound interesting if we talk occasionally
he hesitated
good luck
i feel a maharajah waiting for the tiger to pounce on the tied- up goat forster grinned
i hope i don't have to wait all night
nell shuddered
night
this was a night in their minds a creature from the darker side of man's intellect
something worried her about that thought
something hidden behind the more obvious sentiment
after they'd gone forster felt the silence settle around him
he'd never been one to exercise an over- yet the conditions were the feeling of a tomb of an interment 
would he be found he mused a thousand years from then a dust-covered skeleton
he chuckled
and the uzi a primitive weapon the bio suit ceremonial armour 
the first stunning silence gave way to the creaking of the ship and a far-off booming of the sea against the hull
the radio on the dummy suddenly screeched into action as delaney's distorted voice gave it life 
the thousands of tons of steel made real communication impossible
his own radio was off 
forster settled down only putting his eye to the slit every half minute not continually as he had started to do
he had a good view of the long shadowy main corridor
the only problem was if he corrected himself it came which side turning if any would it use 
the further away the better
the more time to see it approach 
the trouble was the transverse corridor just outside the room
if the approach was that way he would get no warning at all and it would be on top of george his name for the dummy sitting a drunken son-of-a-bitch before he knew it
if that happened he'd have to work fast
what he'd seen done to grant made forster realise that whatever it was struck with demonic speed and savagery
in seconds poor old george would be spread around the room an explosion in harrod's window and the thing would be away
or on him
as if in protest george uttered a blood-curdling lunatic-sounding cackle and fell fractionally forward
forster suppressed a nervous giggle
they reached the main deck dropping down
in a defensive posture eyes searching the stacked containers trying to probe the black jagged recesses between them
lawton scanned upwards
it could be anywhere
even back on the bridge again
we should start in the engine room nell suggested shivering work up through the crew's quarters and then into the complex
confronted with the need to proceed 
delaney took risks plummeting feet first through the hatchways and partly breaking his descent with the handrails falling a parachutist rolling instantly deploying his uzi against 
against what
like forster all he could guess was that it was fast
grant may have been lame but fast or silent
or both
the speed of descent must have cut down the exposure to any residual gas since he felt none of the earlier weirdness as he approached the still sealed engine room door
pandora's box 
he winced at the memory as he hammered on the steel and then looked through the spy port 
in the stroboscopic view the giant pistons were the only things moving until a figure detached itself from the wall its grey colour exactly that of the background steel
a chameleon it moved out of the aisle between machines then stopped and became utterly motionless
delaney's stillness caught the attention of the others
nell's transceivered voice crackled in his headphones
what is it
he didn't want to take his eyes from it equally he wanted somebody else to see it
to confirm 
gently as though he might disturb it he pulled back
take a look for yourself
she did and caught her breath
the creature was large-headed absurdly so its body half man half something lost in the primordial past 
but there could be no doubt that fundamentally it was human
nell knew and not only because she was a female of the same species
she could see in its eyes intelligence
and human fear
but also as a doctor she knew exactly what it was
she told delaney who shook his head with revulsion
nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicions and paradoxically it was the woman in her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing stand in her way 
george the sacrificial dummy hadn't emitted a squeak for a long time
forster scanned the corridor once more
it was empty
just as it always had been
he sat back again eyeing the blank wall before him confident that he'd catch it however good it was
he kept wondering how it had got silk
silk was the meanest toughest professional he'd ever known
and yet he'd disappeared without trace
forster was a fatalist
he shrugged
you could be james bond he thought but if something had your number on it
a gentle breeze broke the absolute silence moving the curtain so that he had to steady it with his hand
instantly alert forster checked through his spy port 
nothing
but a door had opened somewhere
somebody or something had entered the complex
it could be the others returning or the start of his ambush
for god's sake leave your mask on
and that's an order
but delaney's plea was in vain
nell pulled it off got close to the door and shouted
we mean you no harm
you can help us
when she checked through the spyhole it was standing in exactly the same spot unmoving a lizard 
lawton shook his head
can't hear you
try the ship's system again
nell ran to the wall telephone and pushed the digit for engine room
the small light beneath the receiver rests showed that the line was working 
worried delaney followed searching her face fearing the tell-tale signs of toxicity
on impulse and against his better judgment he pulled off his own mask
nell repeatedly pressed the button shouted across at lawton who was now using the spy port 
what's happening
the back of lawton's head shook his radio-projected voice crackling
nothing now
the head jerked just the once to the left so i reckon it heard the phone
he straightened up and came over directing his question at delaney
we ought to get on 
delaney nodded his agreement
leave it nell
his tone was sharp 
it's not going anywhere
she squared up to him defiantly
i can't john
don't you see 
the poor thing is part of this madness
if we can get to it i can learn so much more
and in any case it might die if we don't try and help it soon
delaney averted his gaze from her afraid of what he had seen in her eyes
perhaps it would be better if it did
you don't mean that she said stepping away from him
delaney fiddled awkwardly with his mask preparatory to putting it back on again
for god's sake nell
all i mean is we've got a job to do
and forster's neck's on the line 
don't you owe it to him to come now
she flushed but held on to the phone 
obviously striving to be as controlled as possible she smiled
you two can manage she said calmly
i can do better here on my own
quietly
if i succeed it will unlock a lot of the mystery of what's been done on titron
and
she faltered
 i think we owe it to that pathetic creature in there
pathetic
delaney tried to play down the fear in his voice fear for her
it might be bloody dangerous
certainly something on this ship is
not this one nell said shaking her head with some kind of reassurance
i just know
lawton gestured in the gangway
you may not be at risk from what is in here
what about out there
there's no guarantee that what we're hunting is going to follow the rules 
nell shrugged
that's a risk i'll have to take 
i've got a more important job here 
delaney knew there was no way she would be shifted from her chosen course 
ordering her would be ludicrous under the changed circumstances and in any event a waste of time
but lawton was right
the risk from the other danger or dangers of titron frightened him more
help me secure the stairs behind us he snapped at lawton as much as we can
delaney turned to nell
it might buy you the time you need
but take care
don't be bloody foolish like i am leaving you here
establish contact if you can
no more at this stage 
understand
and don't try and get the door open
but nell was hardly listening
to please him she nodded then despite lawton's presence squeezed delaney's arm
and you
she smiled
watch out
reluctantly delaney made for the gangway
lawton had already shifted some chairs in readiness to form a barricade
he gave him a hand with a large oil drum and then another as nell tearing herself from her appointed task dragged over a bench
as they drew back up the stairs piling on the pieces she threw up at them lawton sniffed
this won't hold anything
just slow it down 
like forster before her nell indicated her pistol and grenades
as long as there's ti me that's all we need
as they descended the stairs delaney paused and took a last look down at her
she smiled shyly then turned away
in a sense as long as he could convince himself that she was safe he was glad she wasn't coming with them
whatever it was they were after it was an unknown quantity unknown that is except for a lethal ferocity
he pulled on his respirator his mind made up to get backto her as soon as he could for nell anderson was all he cared about now
there it went again
forster frowned as he looked through his spy hole
a sound
he couldn't place it but it reminded him strongly of something
the corridor was empty
it had happened three times now
a hissing we gas escaping ending with a funny little squeak
he looked at george wondering if the sound had come from him
satisfied that everything was as it should be he checked his watch
well over half an hour had passed 
they ought to be near him soon
forster searched in a pouch and came up with a glucose sweet
quietly he unwrapped the covering paper then paused as some instinct made him check again
as he did so the sound came nearer louder
his intense scrutiny took in the shadowy and empty lengths of the corridor
apart from some dark patches on the wall that he hadn't noticed before there was nothing to see
his gaze came back to george still sprawled over the control desk
a fly landed on the empty staring vizor and crawled across it
forster was sorely tempted to nip out and confirm that the noise was coming from george by twiddling the volume and tuner but fought down the urge
he sat back pulled off his mask and popped the sweet into his mouth
it took him only seconds to notice the smell
forster choked as the putrefying reek seemed to get right into him
frightened that it was a gas pocket he fumbled with his mask and finally got it back on
his heart was thumping
nothing seemed to be happening all his senses were apparently functioning normally except that the sweet in his mouth seemed permeated with the awful smell had become a slimy lump of filth
he had to get rid of it
forster reached for his mask just as the hissing gas noise sounded right on top of him ending with a little shriek
he knew then where he'd heard something similar before 
it was like a man breathing through a respiratory system with some sort of one-way valve
a shadow fell across the wall opposite as slowly and fearfully he turned
the curtain was a dense opaque greenish-yellow and something was right behind it a shape pressing against the humped plastic standing there looking down at him half seen half imagined 
his hand went out reached for the submachine gun his fingers tightening on the stock
with a blood-curdling growl the curtain was snatched aside
forster half rolled his uzi trembling in his hand as he got off half a clip at point blank range 
but it struck speed attacking snake 
and something else something he saw as the curtain tore away and he looked into the depths of the unbelievable face above him fractionally dulled his reflexes 
friday # september to tuesday # september
once free of the knotted tentacles of the eastern suburbs dalgliesh made good time and by three he was driving through lydsett village
here a right turn took him off the coastal road on to what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditches and fringed by a golden haze of reeds their lumbered heads straining in the wind
and now for the first time he thought that he could smell the north sea that potent but half- tang evoking nostalgic memories of childhood holidays of solitary adolescent walks as he struggled with his first poems of his aunt's tall figure at his side binoculars round her neck striding towards the haunts of her beloved birds
and here barring the road was the familiar old farm gate still in place
its continued presence always surprised him since it served no purpose that he could see except to cut off the headland and to give travellerspause to consider whether they really wanted to continue 
it swung open at his touch but closing it as always was more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar sensation of having turned his back on the workaday world and entered country which no matter how frequent his visits would always be alien territory 
he was driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine trees which bordered the north sea
the only house to his left was the old victorian rectory a square red-brick building incongruous behind its struggling hedge of rhododendron and laurel
to his right the ground rose gently towards the southern cliffs and he could see the dark mouth of a concrete pillbox undemolished since the war and as seemingly indestructible as the great hulks of wave-battered concrete remnants of the old fortifications which lay half-submerged in the sand along part of the beach
to the north the broken arches and stumps of the ruined benedictine abbey gleamed golden in the afternoon sun against the crinkled blue of the sea and breasting a small ridge he glimpsed for the first time the topsail of larksoken mill and beyond it against the skyline the great grey bulk of larksoken nuclear power station
the road he was on veering left would lead eventually to the station but was he knew seldom used since normal traffic and all heavy vehicles used the new access road to the north
the headland was empty and almost bare the few straggling trees distorted by the wind struggled to keep their precarious hold in the uncompromising soil
and now he was passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox and it struck him that the whole headland had the desolate look of an old battlefield the corpses long since carted away but the air vibrating still with the gunfire of long-lost battles while the power station loomed over it a grandiose modern monument to the unknown dead 
on his previous visits to larksoken he had seen martyr's cottage spread out beneath him when he and his aunt had stood surveying the headland from the small top room under the cone of the mill
but he had never been closer to it than the road and now driving up it it struck him again that the description cottage was hardly appropriate
it was a substantial two-storey l-shaped house standing to the east of the track with walls partly flint and partly rendered enclosing at the rear a courtyard of york stone which gave an uninterrupted view over fifty yards of scrub to the grassy dunes and the sea
no one appeared as he drew up and before lifting his hand to the bell he paused to read the words of a stone plaque embedded in the flints to the right of the door
in a cottage on this site lived agnes poley protestant martyr burned at ipswich #th august # aged # years
ecclesiastes chapter # verse #
the plaque was unadorned the letters deeply carved in an elegant script reminiscent of eric gill and dalgliesh remembered his aunt telling him that it had been placed there by previous owners in the late twenties when the cottage was originally extended
one of the advantages of a religious education is the ability to identify at least the better-known texts of scripture and this was one which it needed no effort of memory to recall 
as a delinquent nine-year-old at his prep school he had once been required by the headmaster to write out in his best handwriting the whole of the third chapter of ecclesiastes old gumboil economical in this as in all matters believing that writing lines should combine punishment with literary and religious education
the words in that round childish script had remained with him
it was he thought an interesting choice of text 
that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god requireth that which is past
he rang and there was only a short delay before alice mair opened the door
he saw a tall handsome woman dressed with careful and expensive informality in a black cashmere sweater with a silk scarf at the throat and fawn trousers
he would have recognized her from her strong resemblance to her brother although she looked the elder by some years
she took it for granted that each knew who the other was and standing aside to motion him in she said it's good of you to be so accommodating mr dalgliesh
i'm afraid nora gurney is implacable
once she knew you were on your way to norfolk you were a predestined victim 
perhaps you would bring the proofs through to the kitchen
it was a distinguished face with the deep-set widely spaced eyes beneath straight brows a well-shaped rather secretive mouth and strong greying hair swept upwards and curled into a chignon
in her publicity photographs she could he recalled look beautiful in a somewhat intimidating intellectual and very english mould 
but seen face to face even in the informality of her own house the absence of a spark of sexuality and he sensed a deep-seated reserve made her seem less feminine and more formidable than he had expected and she held herself stiffly as if repelling invaders of her personal space 
the handshake with which she had greeted him had been cool and firm and her brief smile was surprisingly attractive
he knew that he was oversensitive to the timbre of the human voice and hers although not jarring or unpleasant sounded a little forced as if she were deliberately speaking at an unnatural pitch
he followed her down the hall to the kitchen at the back of the house
it was he judged almost twenty feet long and obviously served the triple purpose of sitting room working place and office
the right-hand half of the room was a well-equipped kitchen with a large gas stove and an aga a butcher's chopping block a dresser to the right of the door holding an assortment of gleaming pots and a long working surface with a wooden triangle sheathing her assortment of knives
in the centre of the room was a large wooden table holding a stoneware jar of dried flowers
on the left-hand wall was a working fireplace the two recesses fitted with wall-to-ceiling bookshelves
to each side of the hearth was a high-backed wicker armchair in an intricate closely woven design fitted with patchwork cushions
there was an open roll-top desk facing one of the wide windows and to its right a stable door the top half open gave a view of the paved courtyard
dalgliesh could glimpse what was obviously her herb garden planted in elegant terracotta pots carefully disposed to catch the sun
the room which contained nothing superfluous nothing pretentious was both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and for a moment he wondered why
was it the faint smell of herbs and newly baked dough the soft ticking of the wall-mounted clock which seemed both to mark the passing seconds and yet to hold time in thrall the rhythmic moaning of the sea through the half-open door the sense of well-fed ease conveyed by the two cushioned armchairs the open hearth
or was it that the kitchen reminded dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had found warmth and undemanding uncensorious companionship been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treats
he placed the proofs on the desk refused alice mair's offer of coffee and followed her back to the front door
she walked out with him to the car and said i was sorry about your aunt sorry for you i mean
i expect that for an ornithologist death ceases to be terrible once sight and hearing begin to go 
and to die in one's sleep without distress to oneself or inconvenience to others is an enviable end 
but you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal
formal condolences he thought were never easy to speak or accept and usually sounded either banal or insincere
hers had been perceptive
jane dalgliesh had indeed seemed to him immortal
the very old he thought make our past
once they go it seems for a moment that neither it nor we have any real existence
he said i don't think death was ever terrible to her
i'm not sure that i really knew her and i'm left wishing i'd tried harder
but i shall miss her
alice mair said i didn't know her either
perhaps i should have tried harder too
she was a very private woman i suspect one of those fortunate people who find no other company more agreeable than their own
it always seems presumptuous to encroach on that self-sufficiency
perhaps you share it
but if you can tolerate company i'm having a few people mostly colleagues of alex from the power station to dinner on thursday night
would you care to join us
seven thirty for eight
it sounded he thought more like a challenge than an invitation
somewhat to his surprise dalgliesh found himself accepting 
but then the whole encounter had been a little surprising
she stood regarding him with a serious intensity as he let in the clutch and turned the car and he had the impression that she was watching critically to see how he handled it
but at least he thought as he gave a final wave she hadn't asked him whether he had come to norfolk to help catch the whistler 
three minutes later he raised his foot from the accelerator
ahead of him trudging along on the left of the path was a little group of children the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller children one each side of her clutching the bars
hearing the noise of the car she turned and he saw a peaked delicate face framed with red-gold hair
he recognized the blaney children met once before with their mother walking along the beach
obviously the eldest girl had been shopping the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bags
instinctively he slowed down
they were unlikely to be in real danger the whistler stalked at night not in broad daylight and no vehicle had passed him since he left the coastal road
but the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home
though he had never seen their cottage he seemed to remember that his aunt had told him that it lay about two miles to the south
he recalled what he knew about them that their father earned a precarious living as a painter whose innocuous prettified watercolours were sold in caf�s and tourist shops along the coast and that their mother had been desperately ill with cancer
he wonderedwhether mrs blaney was still alive
his instinct was to pile the children into the car and drive them home but that he knew was hardly sensible
almost certainly the eldest child theresa wasn't it had been taught not to accept lifts from strangers particularly men and he was virtually a stranger
on an impulse he reversed the jaguar and drove quickly back to martyr's cottage
this time the front door was open and a swathe of sunlight lay across the red-tiled floor
alice mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen wiping her hands
he said the blaney children are walking home
theresa is wheeling a pushchair and trying to cope with the twins
i thought i could offer a lift if i had a woman with me someone they know
she said briefly they know me
without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him closed the front door after her without locking it and got into the car
putting it into gear his arm brushed her knee
he was aware of an almost imperceptible withdrawing more emotional than physical a small delicate gesture of self-containment 
dalgliesh doubted whether that half- recoil had anything to do with him personally nor did he find her silence disconcerting
their conversation when they did speak was brief 
he asked is mrs blaney still alive
no
she died six weeks ago
how are they managing 
not particularly well i imagine
but ryan blaney doesn't welcome interference 
i sympathize
once he lets down his defences half the social workers in norfolk amateur and professional will move in on him
when they drew up beside the little band it was alice mair who opened the car door and spoke
theresa here is mr dalgliesh to give you all a lift
he's miss dalgliesh's nephew from larksoken mill
one of the twins had better sit on my lap
the rest of you and the pushchair can fit into the back 
theresa looked at dalgliesh without smiling and said a grave thank you
she reminded him of pictures of the young elizabeth tudor the same red-gold hair framing a curiously adult face both secretive and self-composed the same sharp nose and wary eyes
the faces of the twins softer editions of her own turned towards her questioningly then broke into shy smiles
they looked as if they had been dressed in a hurry and not very suitably for a long walk on the headland even in a warm autumn
one wore a tattered summer dress in pink spotted cotton with double flounces the other a pinafore over a checked blouse
their pathetically thin legs were unprotected
theresa was wearing jeans and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of london's underground across the front
dalgliesh found himself wondering if it had been brought back from a school trip to the capital
it was too large for her and the wide sleeves of limp cotton hung from her freckled arms rags thrown over a stick 
in contrast to his sisters anthony was over a bundle of leggings jumperand a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead beneath which he surveyed their busyness unsmiling a stout imperious caesar 
dalgliesh got out of the jaguar and tried to extricate him from the pushchair but the anatomy of the chair momentarily defeated him
there was a bar beneath which the child's rigid legs were obstinately stuck
the solid uncooperative bundle was surprisingly heavy it was trying to manoeuvre a firm and rather smelly poultice 
theresa gave him a brief pitying smile dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while with the other hand she collapsed the pushchair with a single vigorous shake
dalgliesh took the baby from her while theresa helped the children into the jaguar and commanded with sudden fierceness sit still
anthony recognizing incompetence grasped dalgliesh's hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek so soft that it was the fall of a petal 
throughout these manoeuvrings alice mair sat quietly watching from the car but made no move to help
it was impossible to know what she was thinking
but once the jaguar had moved away she turned to theresa and said in a voice of surprising gentleness does your father know that you're out alone
daddy has taken the van to mr sparks
it's due for its mot test
mr sparks doesn't think it's going to pass 
and i found we'd run out milk for anthony
we have to have milk
and we wanted some more disposable nappies
alice mair said i'm giving a dinner party on thursday evening
if your father agrees would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month
what are you going to cook miss mair 
put your head close so that i can whisper
mr dalgliesh is going to be one of the guests
i want it to be a surprise 
the pale golden head leaned forward towards the grey and miss mair whispered
theresa smiled and then nodded with serious satisfaction in a moment of grave feminine conspiracy
but next morning ruth awakened early and leaving miss beard to her gentle dreams dressed quickly and hurried out of the house
it was another golden day
she still retained her english habit of noting each day's weather always expecting changes marvelling at the hot sunny days which followed one after the other almost with monotony
when she reached the plateau she remained standing watching for joss barnet waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her
there was no longer any need for her to be
discovered 
her sole purpose in being there was to meet him and she was content that he should know it
he was late this morning
or was she earlier than she thought
had she misjudged the time
no matter
she was happy to wait for him certain that soon she would see him riding towards her
then as the minutes passed and there was no sign of him she considered that perhaps he had overslept
it could happen
or had his horse gone lame cast a shoe
she sat down and prepared to wait as long as was necessary
she knew that in the end he would come
after a few more minutes she became restless and stood up again her eyes searching the slope of the hillside and the valley below trying to determine whether some small movement down there was a man on horseback or merely a trick of her imagination
should she set off down the hill to meet him
but perhaps he would come by another route and then she would miss him
at the end of what she reckoned must be an hour she faced the fact that he was not coming
she dropped to the ground again and lay down burying her face in the sweet- grass
she had been mistaken ever to think that he would come
she had let her overwhelming desire feed her imagination had read something into his words his looks his actions which had not been there at all
her face burned with the shame of it
such was the feeling joss barnet had aroused in her that not for one moment did it occur to her to blame him for anything
it was all her fault 
sick at heart she wept
then she dried her eyes on the hem of her petticoat and went slowly back to the house
so you've decided to put in an appearance
cook said
i do seem to recall something about you offering to help me with the party preparations
but of course if you've changed your mind
i haven't ruth snapped 
i'm ready to start now
i don't want any breakfast
hoity-toity
what's the matter with everyone this morning
cook demanded
there's sean o'farrell and the master left in a hurry this hour past for new york city both without a bite inside them and now you
gone to new york
that's what i said
with mrs cranbrook's words ruth's appetite immediately returned 
so he had not failed her after all
how could she have thought that he would
something unforeseen and urgent had happened since sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her
relief surged through her a physical infusion of new blood 
i've changed my mind she said
i would like some breakfast
suddenly i'm hungry
when will they be back 
sean
how should i know
i don't understand business
what i understand is that if the master's not home for the party tomorrow the mistress won't be pleased and that's putting it mildly 
don't you dawdle over your breakfast then not if you intend to make yourself useful 
there's plenty to be done
ruth worked all that day as though she had the strength of ten
they prepared chicken pies the pastry light ruth's heart turtle soup a haunch of venison jellies blancmanges syllabubs trifles and a host of other dishes with still more to be done on the day of the party itself
mrs cranbrook unbent so far as to show approval
you've done very well she conceded 
mrs carson knowing how much was involved had excused ruth from all other duties until anna's bedtime hour
and now it approached 
she took off the voluminous apron cook had lent her and went in search of her charge 
anna was in tears
we're going home she sobbed
i don't want to go back to mrs gutermann's
i want to stay with edward
i want to live with him for ever and ever
ruth could think of few worse fates but her stomach lurched at the thought of leaving millfield
how do you know we're leaving she asked
who told you
miss fitch anna wailed
i don't like miss fitch
i hate her
i daresay wants me to go
perhaps she's mistaken ruth said though she doubted if miss fitch was ever wrong
we'll ask your mama the moment she comes in
i'm afraid it's true mrs carson told them
of course we were only invited for ten days or so
ruth had lost count of time
to her the long summer days had stretched ahead world without end 
we are going to leave on sunday mrs carson went on 
not too early in the day since i daresay we shall all be tired after tomorrow's party
anna tells me she never wants to leave edward ruth said after the child had gone to sleep
mrs carson smiled indulgently
dearest anna
she's a little young for a holiday infatuation but we all have them sooner or later
thank goodness they never last 
and the more intense they are the shorter the duration so anna should soon be over it
will mr barnet be back for the party
ruth asked
i expect you mean will o'farrell be back mrs carson said
and the answer is i don't know
mrs barnet tells me that she expects her husband when she sees him
it's a fact that american men seem to put businessbefore everything
thank goodness englishmen are not like that 
next morning ruth was down in the kitchen early eagerly hoping to find sean there
he could well have returned late at night and she not heard him though she had stayed awake for a long time listening for the sound of the horses the carriage wheels on the drive
there was no sign of sean but mrs cranbrook was already at work
i hope you're ready to help me she said
everybody is busy with this and that as if food wasn't the most important thing 
i'll help mrs cranbrook ruth agreed
they're not back then
she tried to sound nonchalant
not back 
oh you mean o'farrell and the master
not that i know of
there's no telling when return
sometimes they're gone for three or four days at a time
but surely with the party
mrs cranbrook shrugged
he's a law unto himself the master
not for the likes of you and me to question why
the heart had gone out of the day
ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped praying every moment that joss barnet would return before they left millfield next day
but when the day had dragged to evening in spite of all there was to do the time now passed slowly and still there was no sign of the two men she began to lose hope
in the evening bone-tired she left the kitchen and went to put a reluctant anna to bed
then she turned to helping mrs carson
she brushed her mistress's hair and piled it on top of her head in a cluster of curls carefully and meticulously arranged to look quite casual
it was a style ruth had devised herself and mrs carson was delighted with the result
it looks so different she said
you really are quite clever at this ruth
and now for my dress
she looked beautiful in the yellow satin the low-cut bodice tight against her slight figure the skirt billowing out
but ruth had no heart either to appreciate or to envy her mistress
her spirits were at their lowest ebb 
mrs carson gave her maid a sharp compassionate look
she thought she knew the cause of this mood and in a way she was glad to see it
at least it showed that the girl's mind was working in the right direction 
don't worry ruth she said kindly
i dare say o'farrell will be back tomorrow before we leave
and if not there is always new york when the barnets return in the fall 
and now i shan't need you again this evening so apart from looking in on anna from time to time you may do just as you please
had she not been so downhearted ruth would have enjoyed herself
but she had given up all hope of joss barnet returning that evening and nothing else in the world mattered
the party scene was pretty enough
coloured lanterns hung in the trees which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond
torchlights flaring against the night sky and reflected in the water had been set up wherever it was suitable
already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear
ruth had no heart for it
she climbed the stairs to her room then undressed and went to bed wetting the pillow with her tears which held back all day now flowed unchecked
her only comfort was not to have miss beard in her room to be able to suffer in solitude
though she thought sleep would never come eventually it did 
she fell asleep to the sound of music drifting upwards from the drawing-room
when she wakened it was still dark the orchestra still playing though it was not that which had aroused her
penetrating her sleep she had heard the faint click of the door latch and then the familiar squeak of the hinge as the door to her room slowly opened
she raised herself on one elbow blinking her eyes trying to see in the darkness
but enough light came from the landing on to which the door opened to silhouette the man standing there
it was joss barnet
shock made her cry out and he closed the door and moved towards her in quick strides putting his hand across her mouth to stop-her scream
then he sat on her bed and without a word from either of them she went willingly into his arms and was held close in his embrace
she felt his heart beating strong and fast against hers
they stayed like that for a long moment and then he said light the candle
i can't she whispered
someone will see the light under the door
no matter if they do he said
they will not think of me here
only my coachman knows i am home
i have not yet joined the party
you came to me first
she could hardly believe it
he would not tell her this funny bewitching little english girl that he had come to her first because he could not keep away from her
she had been on his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse frightened yet defiant sparking with anger
almost but not quite she had come between him and the work he had had to do in new york city
the moment the work was done he had ordered his coachman to drive him back to millfield as fast as the horses would go
light the candle he repeated
ruth's fingers trembled as she obeyed him
then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other as if it was for the first time
he tracedthe contours of her face with gentle fingers outlining the curve of her mouth stroking her temples
without any hurry in spite of the impatience which had brought him here he caressed the length of her neck and the slope of her shoulders
from out of nowhere ruth remembered dick parker but not this time the pleasure of her union with him only the pain it had brought her on the christmas eve following 
and now although her whole body cried out for fulfilment and she longed for joss barnet to complete what he had surely come to do she knew that she must not let it happen
she turned her face away from him pushed his hand from her
no she cried
you must not 
he gave not the slightest sign of having heard her continuing to stroke her neck and now inserting his fingers under the neckline of her nightshift
she tried again to push him away
please
please don't she cried
it was surprise which made him stop for a second
he smiled at her an unexpectedly tender smile
i won't hurt you he said
don't be afraid
i'm not afraid of being hurt
then what
i'm afraid of afterwards she said hesitantly
if i were to have a child
it would be the end of the world for me
but you won't he assured her
i'll see to that 
i'm not totally callous
you promise
i promise
she lay quiescent and felt his strong fingers quicker now move to unfasten the buttons of her shift one by one
and when he had undone her gown and had difficulty in lifting it over her head she raised herself from the pillow and helped him to take it off
then he pulled down the sheet which was all the bedclothes she had needed on that warm night and she lay naked before him
she observed him without shame as he looked at every part of her
her pleasure was in him and in his delight of her
when at last he stripped off his clothes and came into her it was as if this was the moment to which all her life had been leading 
he was a skilful lover tender and gentle in the beginning then powerful persistent rough almost until his passion rising in harmony with hers the climax came the bursting of a thousand stars the beginning and ending of the world 
afterwards they lay quietly side by side not speaking until he said i must go
not yet she begged
you can't leave me yet
she turned over and lay on top of him trying to pin him down with her own slight weight and he began to fondle her and she him and almost at once they were making love again
you are a sorceress he told her when it was all over 
an enchantress 
women as tempting as you should be kept out of the sight of mortal men
you're not a mortal man ruth said
you're a god 
he laughed out loud
hush she cautioned
someone will hear you
i'm a real man all right he said
as i've just proved to you
and would again if time allowed 
then he stood up and quickly began to dress
i must go and do my duty as a host for what's left of the night
don't leave me she begged
please stay
he looked at her in surprise spoke brusquely
but of course i must go
there's no question
long afterwards ruth realised that this was the moment when she had learned that she could never come first with him
however much he might desire her she would have no more than the allotted space in his life
when am i going to see you again she asked
that also was the wrong thing to say
i can't make plans he said sharply
but we leave tomorrow she exclaimed
that took him by surprise
the deuce you do
well i shall see to that 
my wife will extend the invitation to the carsons
i take it they're not promised elsewhere
oh no ruth said
we're going back to new york city
he finished dressing then came and held her by the shoulders kissing her lightly on the mouth
as he was leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed
from the city he said
you see that i had you in my mind
he was out of the room before she could open the box a dark blue leather affair lined with white velvet against which lay a fine gold chain with a small oval locket set around the edge with seed pearls
she gasped in amazement
it was without doubt the most beautiful thing she had ever owned or ever would
such delicacy such refinement 
her fingers trembling with excitement she fastened it around her neck
it should remain there for ever
she would never take it off
ellen and i lingered on in mama sipcott's for another hour and a half indulging in the sailor's shorebound pastime of planning the perfect voyage
we decided that would sail from the bahamas to panama and thence to the galapagos where we would find darwin's giant tortoises
then we would sail south to easter island to explore the mysterious statues before going to the mutineers' refuge on pitcairn island
after that we would go to tahiti and i saw the excitement grow in ellen as she realised that these plans were so close to coming true 
it was an excitement that matched my own for i had never sailed the south seas and i had long dreamed of that scatter of tiny magically named islands strewn across one third of a globe
by the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine ellen and i had long reached new zealand and were already sailing north towards new caledonia
we were happy
we caught the bus back to ellen's apartment and collected her clothes and notebooks
she was moving back on board in preparation for the next day's early departure
i carried her luggage to the yard noting that even ellen's strident feminism evaporated in the face of two heavy bags and tropical heat
once in the boatyard ellen ran ahead of me evidently eager to reach's air conditioning
then as she reached the dock's edge she suddenly checked
what on earth is that
oh no
she began to run again
when i reached the water's edge i understood her dismay
a large sports-fishing boat was moored alongside but moored so crudely that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fenders but instead had gouged long ugly gashes in's white paint
yet even the gashes were not so ugly as the expensive boat that had caused them
there was nothing wrong with the boat's lines which were sleekly functional but her long powerful hull her upperworks and even the interior of her capacious working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint
the seemingly random and jagged-edged pattern of blue black silver green and white had been designed to disguise a boat's shape from the prying eyes of u-boat captains so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the bahamas
this boat was called and she was clearly an expensive infant for rods and whip- and outriggers splayed from her upperworks the antennae of some outlandish insect 
she boasted a harpoon walkway a fly and above the highest wheel-platform an aluminium canopy which held a radar aerial
the fighting chair on her aft deck had thick white leather straps giving it the of a padded electric chair while the dazzle paint gave the boat an oddly military look that was completed by the number # that was painted on her bows in silver-edged black numerals like those warships use to display their commissioning numbers
the boat's wrap-around windscreens were made of black polarised glass which only added to's ugly air of menace
ellen unencumbered with luggage had already reached and taken two plastic fenders from a locker
she swung lithely down to's gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hulls
how bad is the damage
i called down to her when i reached 
it's scraped back to bare metal
i'll give it some paint
's hull was made of steel and while such hulls are marvellously strong and safe they are soon weakened if their steel is exposed to salt air
i had to paint the gashes as soon as possible so that rust would not begin to bite into's long sleekness 
ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat
you'd think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fenders
who cares
just cut the damn boat loose i said vengefully
ellen ignored my advice while i obedient to the rule that if a job needed doing then do it without delay found a pot of white paint and dug through the locker for a clean brush
then from behind me an unfamiliar voice sounded oh ring my bells 
it was a man's voice drawling and lazy 
i twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun but then through the dizzying glare i made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed incongruously to be dressed in a long transparent dressing gown
he was emerging in stately fashion from's companion and though i could see he was tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair i could make out no details of his face
who the hell are you
i demanded
the man ignored me walking instead towards ellen who dressed only in shorts and t-shirt was climbing long-legged over's rail
be still my restless heart the man had a strong caressing voice and the slow luscious accent of america's deep south
dear lady dear lady to think that i might have lived my whole life through and never seen you
oh lay me down just lay me down
ellen usually so quick with a scornful reply just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her took her hand then bowed above her fingers
he kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckles then closed his eyes
dear sweet lord above i do thank thee for thy kindness in showing me this lovely woman before i died
to my astonishment and chagrin ellen left her hand in his as he opened his eyes and smiled at her
my name he stroked her with his voice is jesse isambard sweetman
and who dear creature are you
ellen still said nothing
i had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and i could see sweetman properly and what i saw i did not like
his face was old and young sardonic and knowing amused and handsome the face of a man who has seen the world's wickedness and knows how to match it with his own
his long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon his skin was parchment pale and his eyes dark 
i put his age at forty but even among men twenty years younger he would have been accounted handsome and he knew it for his expression showed both confidence and amusement as he continued to hold ellen's hand and he showed even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty she was thus granting him and jerked her fingers swiftly away
thus released jesse sweetman turned to look at me
the dressing gown had proved to be a long stylish ankle-length duster coat which was loosely woven from a delicate white cotton
beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trousers that were tucked into tall black boots
it was a dramatic and impractical outfit of a kind i only expected to see on the male models who posed in the more outlandish fashion magazines that our rich clients brought aboard yet jesse isambard sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style with an elegant insouciance
the only incongruous note was a cheap round badge enamelled in red and yellow that he wore on his shirt which bore the legend just say no
you must be nicholas breakspear he said carelessly as though he did not much care whether i was or not
is that gaudy piece of junk your boat
i gestured to where's aerials showed above's gunwale
sweetman turned and pretended to notice the sports-fishing boat for the first time
no he said helpfully then bestowed a patronising smile on me
you look so like your father
it's really uncanny
did you bring that boat here
i persevered
oh indeed i did he said brightly as though he merely indulged a rather dim child's curiosity
your mother was malise fielding am i right
or are you lucy de sills son
why the hell didn't you use fenders when you tied alongside
he sighed intimating what a bore i was being
i did not use fenders breakspear because i despise precautions
precautions are the symptoms of small and fearful minds
precautions will not conquer empires they will not build great cities they will not transmute dreams into gold or carry men across wide oceans and precautions will not emphatically not win fair ladies and here he turned to ellen and lasciviously dropped his gaze to her long bare legs
ellen twisted away and sweetman laughed at her obvious discomfiture then as coolly as though he owned he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first brushed at then sat on one of the white cushioned seats by the ship's wheel
i've had a look round the boat he said very coolly and i approve of her 
so tell me the cost of a week's charter
the man you want to see i said is called matthew mcillvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase
he's not here this afternoon but you can doubtless telephone him next week
sweetman took a pair of polarised sunglasses from his shirt pocket and put them on before inspecting me again
he did not seem to like what he saw
you're really not being noticeably helpful he said after a pause so let us try again shall we
would you please tell me the high season price for one week
how many passengers
ellen asked before i could refuse to answer
sweetman paused again this time to light a long pale blue cigarette with a slim gold lighter
he shrugged
two four six passengers
does it really matter
one week in high season costs ten thousand us dollars for two people and every extra couple is another thousand bucks
ellen's voice was cold as though she disliked satisfying his curiosity
and to those prices you have to add the boat's running costs
which are
sweetman asked carelessly
a lot 
ellen said flatly
you're talking fuel food and liquor plus any toys you might want aboard like scuba equipment snorkels jet-skis or sailboards
sweetman drew on his fancy cigarette then blew a plume of smoke into's rigging before smiling lazily at ellen
and tell me sweet creature do you count as a toy 
or are you a part of the initial ten thousand dollars 
get off the boat i said
shut up
he turned on me a snake 
you're nothing but a hired hand breakspear so shut the fuck up
he glanced at the paint pot and brush that i was still holding
go and paint something
be useful
he stared into my eyes challenging me to defy him and when i did not move he looked back to ellen
i asked you a question dear heart 
please be so good as to answer
get off this boat i told him but my anger only amused sweetman who unfolded his long thin legs from the cushioned thwart
dick off he said to me
i was surprised that he so eagerly sought to confront me
i am not a small man nor am i a weakling yet the thin sweetman seemed unconcerned as i jumped down into the cockpit 
then i saw why he was so confident
he put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small # pistol that he pointed at my face
a ladies gun he said but remarkably effective at close range
nick
ellen called warningly as though i might not have seen the gun
the gun's threat had not stopped my advance
i was calling sweetman's bluff confident he would not dare pull the trigger and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn him into mincemeat 
i was also half drunk and thus filled with the dutch courage offered by mama sipcott's worst white wine
sweetman stood
there was at last a look of alarm on his face and i could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger
he held the gun pointed at my eyes
we beat southwards all that first day slicing through a glittering sea and propelled by an apparently changeless south-easterly trade wind
we hardly saw the crowninshield twins
they briefly appeared on deck for lunch a meal which rickie hardly touched while robin-anne despite her apparent frailty attacked the sandwiches and salad savagery starving bear 
afterwards incongruously dressed in a raincoat she went to the bows and stared briefly down at the mesmerising onrush of sea where it split and foamed at's cutwater
she did not stay there long but retreated from the fierce sun to the stern-cabin that she would be sharing with ellen
the contrast between the two american girls was almost painful ellen was so healthy and strong while the waif-like robin-anne was pathetically wan and listless
what do you think of her
i asked ellen that afternoon
ellen gave me an amused glance
little orphan annie
it's hard to believe she's about to be worth six million dollars
still she's got precious little else going for her
i smiled at the severity of ellen's judgment
is she that bad
she has a distressingly simple mind with only room for a single idea at any one time
presently that idea is cocaine and nothing but cocaine
she has an obsession with the drug that verges on monomania
she tells me she needs to understand it if she's going to defeat it
don't you approve of that 
i think she'd do better to understand herself ellen said tartly 
she allowed a man to persuade her into taking the drug so she can only blame herself for her predicament
she'd find it more useful to understand her own character short�comings than to take an elementary course in drug chemistry
what do you make of rickie
i asked
he's precisely what anyone would expect of a drop-out phys ed basketball-playing retard ellen said scornfully by which i mean that he's a jock brains dung beetle 
he reminds me of your neanderthal friend the maggot except rickie is a great deal more handsome
is he
she laughed at the suspicion of jealousy in my voice
yes nicholas he is
but he's not cute
at supper as at lunch robin-anne ate appetite horse though her brother hardly touched his chicken and pasta salad
don't you like pasta
ellen who was perversely proud of her skills in the salad department asked rickie with just a touch of asperity
it's great 
really awesome
rickie lit a cigarette
i just guess i'm not hungry
robin-anne reached over and tipped her brother's food on to her own plate
kind of starving she justified her theft then poured herself some diet soda
for once we were carrying neither wine nor spirits on for jackson chatterton's drug clinic had utterly forbidden us to offer the twins any alcohol saying that any mood-altering drug could hamper the success of a detoxification programme
we were thus officially a dry boat though i had hidden some irish whiskey in the engine room and i was sure that ellen would have similarly salted away some vodka
it seemed that ellen and i were not the only ones to take such a precaution for late that night jackson chatterton lumbered on deck with a bottle in one huge hand
bourbon he explained laconically
want some
i thought you'd never ask
he chuckled produced two cardboard cups and poured me a generous slug of the whiskey
we were alone on deck though not the only ones awake for i could hear rickie and ellen's voices coming from the open skylight of the main saloon
i hoped thessy was fast asleep for he would be taking the morning watch
cheers i said
chatterton raised his cardboard cup in silent acknowledgement then stared ahead to where a great beam swept around the sky
a lighthouse he asked in a voice which suggested that a prudent man avoided such things 
i nodded
it's called the hole in the wall
once we're past it we can turn out to the open ocean
things will be a bit livelier then
livelier
we'll have a bit more sea kick up some spray
i had spoken enthusiastically but jackson chatterton seemed unmoved by the prospect 
what are your plans he asked me
i had nothing particular planned merely an idea that it might be interesting to thrash our way out into the open ocean though mindful of the danger of tropical storms i had no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a bahamian hurricane hole
but i fancied feeling the long hard pressure of ocean waves against our hull and though we were short-handed i reckoned that a few days out sight of land would shake us all down quickly
i explained all that to chatterton but stressed that we would run for cover at the first sign of trouble
he must have assumed that i meant trouble from the twins for he suddenly became surprisingly loquacious
they won't give you any grief in the next few days he said
now that they can't get hold of cocaine they'll just crash out
i grimaced
does that mean they'll be seeing green monkeys and blue snakes up the rigging
chatterton poured himself more bourbon then put the bottle within my reach on the binnacle shelf
coming off cocaine isn't like that 
at first they'll just want to do nothing but eat and sleep
it's the opposite of a cocaine high you see 
he paused
the difficult bit starts two or three days later
that's when the real hell begins
for all of us
it won't be easy he said grimly and i was suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn chatterton aboard
the big man had obviously come on deck to warn me what to expect from the twins and for that i was grateful
i noticed that rickie wasn't eating today i said but robin-anne was 
chatterton nodded
rickie may have stopped his cocaine a day or two ago which means he's probably already over the crash period
i promise you one thing he's brought none of it on board
i searched him and his luggage and he was clean 
the big man thought for a few seconds then laughed
he'd better be clean 
that turkey has got one chance of avoiding jail just one and that chance is by proving to the judge that he's cleaned up his act 
and if he doesn't do that then the man will send rickie's plump young ass down to the gang-rape squad in the county jail
chatterton did not sound unduly worried at that prospect 
can we be sure robin-anne didn't bring any of the drug aboard
i asked
she won't have done that chatterton said with conviction 
that girl is serious about giving it up real serious heavy serious
that girl is really trying
she studiesthe drug you know
it was her enemy 
chatterton had spoken with genuine admiration
i glanced up at the sails down at the compass then ahead to where the lighthouse loom arced powerfully through the night
so what are the twins chances
depends on their will power 'cause nothing else will do it for them
there ain't no pill to get you off the powder mr breakspear only will power 
and let me tell you coming off coke is the hardest damn thing in the world and you're real lucky if you have a rich daddy who pays for people to hold your hand while you go through the hell of it
the twins daddy has paid for you and me mr breakspear and for everyone else on board thisboat but even with all that money and all this boat we still might not succeed with them
it's that hard 
it is that hard he said ominously and i thought of john maggovertski's sadness for a pretty girl who had whored herself to pay for the white powder
and it's even harder jackson chatterton's voice was suddenly sinister for a poor person who has no one to help them
i stared at jackson chatterton and at last sensed the drama that lay behind his big calm presence
why did you leave the army mr chatterton
i asked after a long pause
i guess you can guess he said
i guessed but did not make him confirmmy guess
instead i
asked whether the american army had helped him to kick his drug habit 
sure they tried they tried real hard but back then i didn't
want to be helped
but you still got off cocaine
on your own
eventually
the light inside the binnacle glossed his black
face with a sheen of red sparking his eyes like fire
he was not looking at me but staring doggedly ahead into the turning white light of the hole in the wall
and i had to lose a good good woman before i came to my senses
but i did kick the drug mr breakspear and it was probably the hardest damned thing i ever did in all my life
but once i'd done it i swore i'd help others do it
even the very rich
i asked provocatively
the rich trash pay the bills mr breakspear which lets me give my spare time away to the poor trash 
i looked at the tough impressive face
are the twins trash 
he paused before replying then gave the smallest shake of his head
she's ok but him
this time the pause was almost eloquent then he gave a richly contagious laugh
i'd have liked to have had rickie crowninshield in my platoon for just five minutes
i laughed too
good to have you aboard
it ain't bad being aboard he said and held out his hand and not before time we shook
by midnight i was alone on deck and happy to be alone
i like sailing alone at night
i like to watch the phosphorescence curling away from the hull and i like to watch the brilliant specks of light fade in the black deep water far in the ship's wake
i like to be alone under the careless profusion of the stars and alone on a moon-glossed sea
i like the sounds of a boat sailing at night
the sounds are the same as those of daylight yet somehow the night magnifies and sharpens the creak of a yielding block the sigh of air over a shroud the stretching of a sail the hiss of water sliding sleek against the hull the curl of a quarter-wave falling away and the thump as a wave strikes the cutwater to be sheared into two bright slices of whiteness
i like the purposefulness of a boat at night as it slits a path across an empty planet
i like the secretiveness of a boat in the blackness when the only thing to dislike is the prospect of dawn which seems a betrayal because at night in a boat under sail it is easy to feel very close to god for eternity is all around 
i tacked the ship shortly after midnight doing the job by myself and enjoying the work
ellen was still awake talking in the stateroom with rickie but everyone else seemed asleep
i wished that ellen and rickie would go to their beds for the soft mutter of their voices was an intrusion on the dark and star-studded infinity through which i steered 
the picture very like the one rufus fletcher had taken in the summer of # occupied the screen for about fifteen seconds
the whole item was allowed no more than four times that in the bbc's sunday evening news broadcast at #
the other forty-five seconds were taken up by a policeman talking to a reporter about having nothing to say except that there would be an inquest
but shiva and lili manjusri saw the picture and so did rufus fletcher
adam verne-smith unwinding in puerto de la cruz did not of course see it
he did not even see an english newspaper
they were expensive to buy and came a day late
he did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at was the a copy of which anne found on the beach
his father at home in edgware said to his wife
good god wyvis hall as i live and breathe
beryl verne-smith peered but the picture immediately vanished
yes i suppose it was
the policeman talked the reporter trying to jog him into revelations and failing
in the background autumnal trees could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill
lewis verne-smith sat shaking his head less as a gesture of denial than of a generalized despair at the state of the world
it was not that unpleasant memories were evoked for these were always with him his existence was inseparable from that old bitterness but that a sight of the house even the glimpse of a photograph revived the precise feelings he had had why it must be getting on for eleven years ago
ten and a half said his wife
i shall have to get in touch with the police
no two ways about it i shall have to get in touch with them
not this evening surely said beryl who wanted to watch mastermind
lewis said nothing
the room in which they were sitting underwent the curious shrinking process to which it was subject whenever he was reminded of wyvis hall or his uncle hilbert or even if the county of suffolk were mentioned
suddenly it grew small and poky
the brick side-wall of his neighbour's house to have moved itself four or five feet further towards the dividing fence so that it loomed offensively
lewis got up and pulled the curtains across with a pettish jerk of his hands
shouldn't you wait until adam gets back 
beryl said
why
what would that be in aid of
beryl meant that adam had been among the previous owners of wyvis hall while her husband had not but she knew better than to point this out 
there is no one living knows that lovely place better than #
that's true 
i shan't wait till adam returns lewis said in that manner that had once led his daughter to call him the frog footman 
but i shall wait until tomorrow
men and women do not usually put their baser feelings and intentions into words not even in the deep recesses of their own minds
so lewis did not say even to himself when he was privately considering trying to get hold of his son in tenerife that he disliked adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday
instead he rationalized his thoughts and justified himself adam probably indeed almost certainly knew nothing about the find in the pine wood but adam had once owned the house and had thus taken on a responsibility
he could not shed that responsibility just because he had sold the place
lewis would have agreed with oscar wilde that our past is what we are
we cannot rid ourselves of it
therefore it was adam's duty to come home and face the music even though this might be no more than a short blast on a tin whistle 
but he had no precise idea where adam was and he did not think adam's travel agent a personal friend of the young verne-smiths would tell him
some excuse would be made for not telling him
lewis's bark anyway was always worse than his bite 
he had virtually no bite as he had once overheard adam say to bridget and heard it with helpless chagrin
a bloody good thing or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore
lewis walked into his local police station in edgware on monday morning
they seemed surprised to see him but not astonished
the suffolk police had begun hunting up previous owners of wyvis hall and they had been alerted that a verne-smith lived in their area
there were after all only two in the london phone directory
this might be a bonus 
he was asked to wait and then shown into a room where a detective sergeant prepared to take a statement from him
with busy pomposity lewis dictated it to a typist and would have gone on and on had he not been diplomatically restrained 
wyvis hall nunes suffolk and the twenty acres of land surrounding it were the property through his marriage of my uncle hilbert verne-smith
they came into the possession of my son hilbert john adam verne-smith under my uncle's will bypassing myself though my son was no more than nineteen at the time of my uncle's death
being an undergraduate at the time my son naturally never considered actually residing in the house
he was in agreement with my suggestion that the property be sold and before he returned to college in the autumn of # he took my advice and placed house and lands in the hands of an estate agent 
country properties were not selling well at the time
# was the asking price and i was not surprised that the sale so to speak hung fire 
however in the spring of # an offer was made which my son accepted
this sale later fell through and it was not until the following august that wyvis hall was finally sold to a mr and mrs langan for the much improved figure of #
as far as i know my son's personal acquaintance with wyvis hall was confined to my uncle's lifetime when # my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him
after my uncle's death in april # he visited wyvis hall on perhaps two or at the most three separate occasions simply for the purpose of looking it over and reaching a decision about the disposal of furniture and effects
i suppose it is possible that squatters or other vagrants took possession of the house between the time of my uncle's death and the sale of the property
certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it on either a temporary or permanent basis
my son is at present on holiday in tenerife with his wife and daughter
i cannot say precisely when i expect him to return though i should suppose in about a week from now
it was all very small and quiet and low-key 
the snippet in rufus's monday morning newspaper measured just an inch in depth 
it answered the question he had asked himself and told him that the bones of a very young child had been found as well as those of a young woman
this was not a shock 
how could it be otherwise since this was wyvis hall and the pine wood and the animal cemetery
to photograph the house for the news last night the cameraman must have stood just where he had stood himself on the edge of the lawn with his back to the cedar tree
a popular
mass-produced camera he had used but quite a good one
one thing about zosie's pilfering she never stole rubbish 
he had taken a picture of her after that and one of the animal cemetery 
why is the grass always so short up here
adam had asked
rabbits i expect 
why can't bloody rabbits come and eat my lawns
adam always referred to my lawns my house my furniture
it had got up rufus's nose a bit though adam had a perfect right to do this 
it was his all of it and it went to his head rather
nineteen-year-olds seldom inherit country mansions after all
it must have been some time in august when i took those pictures rufus thought and a couple of weeks later it was all over 
coincidentally as the community and their lives together broke up so did the weather
it was raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery the pines bowing and shivering in the wind
sometimes they had had to stop and take shelter under the closely planted-trees
if the weather had held and still been hot and dry would they have dug deeper
probably not
in spite of the rain the earth was still hard iron 
a sheet of rain had come down then a hard gusty shower while they were laying the squares of turf back in place and adam had said something about the rain making the grass grow quickly the rain being on their side 
we should all go our separate ways as soon as we can rufus had said
we should pack up now and go
the spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tools in the stables
they had packed and adam had locked up the house
at some point rufus himself had taken the things out of the fridge and left the door open to defrost it
adam closed the front door and stood there for a moment as if he could not wrench himself away
so much of its beauty had been stripped from it by the whipping winds
and by the neglect of the long hot summer
a sudden gust of rain dashed against the red bricks that were already stained in patches by water
the house that when he first saw it had to float on a raft of golden mist now lay in a wilderness amidst ragged grass and straggling bushes and trees dead from the heat
dirty grey clouds tumbled across the sky above the slate roof now the only thing that shone glazed with rain
but rufus admitted to himself that the beauties of nature and architecture had never meant much to him
it was the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked
and now he longed only to get away
they all got into goblander and he drove away up the drift adam next to him the others in the back 
the drift had become a tunnel of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van
none of them allowed their eyes to turn towards the pine wood
at the top they came out into uncompromising bright grey light the bleak hedgeless lane the flat meadows where here and there stunted trees squatted old men in cloaks 
adam's simile not his thought rufus with a grimace
no one asked where he was taking them
no one spoke
adam had hilbert's old golf-bag stuck between his legs and rufus guessed the gun was inside it
they must have gone a good two miles before they met another car
rufus overtook a bus going to colchester and dropped the two in the back so that they could catch it
he took adam on to sudbury for him to catch a train there and at that point they parted
adam got down from goblander and said
for ever and for ever farewell rufus
which was probably a quotation from something though rufus did not know what and thought fastidiously that it was in bad taste histrionic though just like adam
take care said rufus and not looking back any more than he had done when they returned from the cemetery drove off round the town he had got to know so well over the stour bridge into essex heading for halstead and dunmow and ongar and london
he never had seen any of them again
there had been no need to pretend to turn aside
briefly starting his fifth year in medical school something over thirteen months later he had wondered if shiva manjusri would be one of the incoming freshmen
but no his intuition had been accurate 
at any rate shiva's face was not among the several brown faces
as for the others avoiding them had presented no problems 
would they get in touch with him now
no contingency plans had been made for this eventuality
so long as there was no hunt for a missing girl they had felt themselves reasonably safe 
their minds had not reached out to the terror of what had in fact happened
none of them had been the kind of people who could have imagined devotion to a pet animal or according to it funerary rites
it was shiva who had proposed the site
they had congratulated him on his ingenuity
ten years
an ovarian cyst nothing to get upset about rufus told ms beauchamp
she was thirty-two an editor with a distinguished publishing house married to an investigative journalist
as yet they had no children but she wanted four she told rufus
no reason why you shouldn't
he had another glance at her notes
in fact a peculiarity about this condition is that it seldom if ever occurs in a woman who's had a baby
my god she said putting her coat on
'and there was # making my husband's life a misery sure i'd got the dreaded c
they all thought they'd got the dreaded c poor things 
you couldn't blame them
rufus took her # off her by the reception desk having set in train the arrangements by which she would be admitted to a fashionable west end clinic with rufus her surgery and her hospitalization ultimately paid for by some provident association to which she and her husband subscribed
rufus shook hands
he walked back to his consulting room dying for a cigarette
this was unlike him
he could usually get through quite easily until after lunch
he thought i know what my idea of heaven would be if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to pass eternity a sanctuary where one might chain-smoke without impairment of breathing destruction of the lungs or damage to the heart light each fresh cigarette from the glowing butt of its predecessor and drink ice-free but hundred-proof chilled vodka laced with two drops of angostura and a gill of newly opened perrier endlessly with increasing euphoria until a peak of joy and ease was reached but without any sub-sequent nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion
sitting alone he lit his cigarette the first of the day and there came that faint swimming in the head a tautening of the gut
he closed his eyes
if it comes to light that i was in that house with adam and the others he thought with cold clarity if someone tells the papers or the police and thence the papers that i was there during the summer of # living there it will be all up with me
i will lose my practice and my reputation and everything that i have and can look forward to if not my liberty
and without the rest i shan't care about my liberty
it would be bad enough if i were a g p or an expert in some other branch of medicine an orthopaedic surgeon for instance or an ear nose and throat man but i am a and it is the bones of a young woman and a baby that have been found there
what worried woman would come to me
what mrs strawson or ms beauchamp
what gp would send her to me
if i were innocent thought rufus i know very well what i would do
i would pick up the phone and phone my solicitor and ask to come and see him and get his advice
he might advise me to make a statement to the police which i should of course do under his guidance 
but i shall not do this because i am not innocent
i shall sit here and wait and sweat it out and look the facts in the face trying to anticipate the worst that can happen
the wonderful thing about the human mind adam thought is the way it copes when the worst happens
beyond that worst happening you think there can be nothing the unimaginable has taken place and on the other side is death destruction the end 
but the worst happens and you reel from it you stagger the shock is enormous and then you begin to recover 
you rally you stand up and face it
an hour maybe and you are making contingency plans 
for what had happened was not the worst you realized that 
the worst was yet to come was perhaps always yet to come never would actually come because if it did you would know it that would be reality and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself
quickly
now that he was able to he assembled what had happened and laid the facts before himself
they had dug up those bones at wyvis hall and had decided it was murder they were investigating
bones skeletons bodies do not bury themselves
those were the facts as far as he knew them up to this moment
he would know more much more in the days to come 
what was certain was that he could no longer use the escape key
it was defunct
the passages it cancelled had in any case as in certain programmes not been lost but stored on some limbo disc from whence they must now be retrieved 
adam sat in his parents' house drinking tea
there must be a total retrieval now the one good thing about which was that it might banish his dreams
he was aware of a slight feeling of sickness and of cold an absence of hunger though he had been feeling quite hungry when he got off the plane
anne sat next to him on his mother's cretonne-covered settee and abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor kicking with her legs and punching with her arms
his mother kept poking toys which she did not want at her
a passage from a novel by john o'hara came back to adam
he had memorized it years ago in the ecalpemos epoch the safest way to live is first inherit money second be born without taste for liquor third have a legitimate job that keeps you busy fourth marry a wife who will cooperate in your sexual peculiarities fifth join some big church sixth don't live too long
apart from the last one which he hadn't got to yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in america more than here here he had joined the golf club he had complied with all the rest
or his nature and luck had complied for him
nemesis had still come down the wolf on the fold 
he had not wanted to come back here
but there had been no spirit in him the shock of what his father told him had been too great 
something that will interest you adam something to make you sit up 
they've dug up a lot of human bones at my old uncle's house 
by the time he had rallied and got himself together and was thinking of things to say to the police it was too late and they were heading north
anne was furious
when lewis said to come back with him and eat there adam had got a kick on the ankle from anne and another kick when he hadn't replied
he had turned on her and said with cold savagery for fuck's sake stop kicking me will you
he expected his father to rise and say something about that being no way to speak to one's wife or not in front of the child he was capable of that 
but he had said nothing only looked subdued and adam realized why
his own terrible fear and anger had communicated itself to his father and shown him what the better part of valour was keeping silent
having put the cat among the pigeons made mischief in his special way he was lying low now and waiting
the old bastard 
adam only wished uncle hilbert left him wyvis hall and then there would have been no ecalpemos no zosie and no deaths
and adam couldn't see he would have been much worse off 
he and anne would be living in a house like this one rather than that neo-georgian palace 
children after all he thought looking at abigail were happy wherever they were so long as they were loved 
his parents had not asked him what sort of holiday he had had or how the flight had been
the conversation was exclusively on the subject of the discovery at wyvis hall
adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an english newspaper while away
if he had done the shock would have been less but on the other hand his holiday would have been spoilt 
he would have liked very much to be alone
of course he knew there was no possibility of this now or when he returned home for when you were married you never could be alone
presumably that was the point 
what was he going to tell anne
how much was he going to tell her
he didn't know
none of it if he could help it
they sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early high tea
lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited wyvis hall and had walked in here and astounded them with his news
he had a beard then anne
lewis's subdued air had changed to one of high good humour
you wouldn't have recognized him he looked john the baptist 
adam could remember very well but he wasn't going to say so
what a funny thing said lewis
we had ham salad that day too
what a coincidence
oh yes i've been meaning to ask you who was it looked after wyvis hall while you were in greece
adam could eat nothing
the other time he remembered it was his father who hadn't been able to eat
he didn't know what lewis meant about someone looking after the house but no doubt he adam had at the time concocted some tale to keep his father quiet to keep him away even
someone from the village you said lewis persisted
how can i remember that far back 
the police will want to know
it may be of vital importance
aren't you going to eat your meat dear said beryl
abigail who had been put upstairs in one of the bedrooms to sleep set up a wailing sound
adam was on his feet at once 
i think we should go
they had to wait until his father was ready
adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but lewis wouldn't hear of it
anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while adam was in the back with abigail
if his father could have found out what flight they were coming on the police certainly could
it was possible they might be waiting for him
they would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of wyvis hall
he looked again at the newspaper account of the adjourned inquest that his father had saved for him
it would be owners and occupants of wyvis hall between nine and twelve years before that they would wish to interview and those were great-uncle hilbert who was dead himself and ivan langan to whom he had sold the house
as for other occupants how would they know who else had lived there 
it was ironical that ten days before he had seen shiva at heathrow
the encounter he now saw an omen a shadow cast by a coming event
what would that event be
adam did not want at this point to speculate it made hi� feel sick 
he turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that headline and those paragraphs
in high spirits his father was talking about the immense advances made in forensic science in recent years
as soon as they got home anne started getting abigail to bed
their cases humped upstairs and put into the bedroom adam looked rufus fletcher up in the phone book
he was in there twice at a wimpole street number and again at an address in mill hill rufus h fletcher mb mrcp
all these years then or for some of them rufus had been living three or four miles from him
he couldn't look shiva up because he couldn't remember his surname
women marry and change their names he thought there was no point in pursuing that one
of course he could look up robin tatian but where really would that get him
he was reaching-for the blue directory when anne came back with abigail in her arms so adam took her and carried her back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her
she was almost asleep
he wondered if rufus had children and if so did he worry about them coming to terrible harm the way adam worried 
was his whole life affected by what had happened at ecalpemos
adam might have escaped the file memories for years suppressed them and jerked violently away from them but he had never been able to pretend he was unscathed by those events
sometimes he felt that he was the person he was because of them and acted the way he did because of their effects
he sat by abigail's cot not wanting to remember but knowing that now he must
there was nothing in his house to remind him of ecalpemos
everything that was left everything he and rufus hadn't sold had gone to ivan langan with the house
for a song too because he had not been able to bear the thought of going back meeting a valuer walking about the house picking things off shelves and out of cupboards
only once had he returned after they all left and that had been bad enough a dream no stepping into the set and scenario of some frightening film a hitchcock movie perhaps
he asked the taxi he had taken to put him down at the top of the drift and he had walked to the house
it was almost a year since he had been there and in that time nothing had been done nothing had been touched
from the pine wood he simply averted his eyes till later
the drift was thickly overgrown a dank tunnel out of whose bushy sides the tendrils of brambles and briar roses caught at his clothes
one of these whipped back at him and as he caught at it a thorn drove into the fleshy pad of his finger
that thorn had been there festering for months
a dull cool summer it had been as different as could be from the year before 
no golden light bathed the red brick of the house
it no longer looked mellow 
beautiful yes but severe somehow and to adam's heightened awareness reproachful 
he found himself encouraging fostering the scenario illusion
only thus only by pretending unreality pretending this was a part he acted could he go on cross the wild shaggy grass go past the black-branched cedar tree arrive at the porch set in its four doric columns and insert his key in the lock
conclusion
task analysis has not and cannot be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course 
the techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do
the danger in being too rigid is that justice will not be done to the flexibility and complexity of human performance
the danger of being too flexible is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design interfaces training courses and other operator aids
if a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task cannot be allocated to a technical device rather than a human being
yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance may be unreliable or unpredictable
there is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system
as mentioned earlier there are always the twin problems of how to get the information and how to present it
it is sometimes easier to proceed on the basis of if i were doing the job this is how i would do it but this can be delusory even for analysts who have past experience as operators
for analysts who are designers creating a new task there may be no alternative but any task description arrived at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operators as they gain experience
a particular difficulty about task synthesis is that there is no easy way of confirming completeness
a task description which is part of a design process should be fully documented in terms of the origins of information the assumptions made and the methods used
the standard method of producing task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks at various levels on cards and then assemble the cards in a network 
there is a temptation to make these final diagrams very large but often it is more useful to separate into small units with cross-referencing
the optimum size seems to be a# this is easily copied and circulated but is large enough to contain considerable detail
the procedure can be computerised there are programmes available for the easy production manipulation and storage of block diagrams with useful cross-referencing facilities 
there is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task analysis is from the act of obtaining it
those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description
like reference books they have to be used rather than read
task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower but in looking at cost value it is important to include in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team conducts the analysis
if such a team is usedthe required man-hours can be optimised byusingthe delphi method rather than a long series of group meetings
political economic and social issues which arise in conducting task analyses are discussed in the context of job analysis p #
application 
man-power planning
the humanresource concept of man-power as the central profit�generating asset of any organisation has made some progress over the past twenty years
there was particular interest around # when companies were prosperous stable and innovative ipm # patten #
the objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a resource consuming factor requiring regular payments overheads in the form of heated lighted equipped workspaces and so on
from the narrow accountancy viewpoint people are a cost and it is desirable to keep this cost as low as possible
in these terms it is very difficult to justify for example sending a member of staff on a training course 
the training requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away
where is the return 
the return is actually in the improved humanresource but this is not readily measurable in terms which accountants use 
there have been two attempts to reduce humanresources to this form of measurement giles and robinson #
one is to acquire a humanasset multiplier for each level of staff
the multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases with staff level and becomes three or more for management
the other is to add together all the personnel costs for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payments
the first does attempt to obtain a value the second remains essentially a cost and not a value
it would be unduly optimistic to assume that management skills have risen to a level such that costs undertaken can be assumed to be equivalent to value
a less direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaves or joins a company
this can be very high for a large company a change in market value of millions of pounds is not unusual 
the most serious consequence of the accountancy view of man-power is that high level policy decision-making does not give this factor sufficient weight 
for example the main board of a company will have complete details of cost and values of physicalresources such as buildings and equipment but relatively scanty data about the man-power which is their most important asset 
indeed it will be described almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known
similarly broad factors such as the state of morale will again only be described bynegative features such as absenteeism stoppages strikes low quality output and so on
it is obvious that company output and projects must reflect the man-power and its performance level but if this is acknowledged at all it is only in brief verbal terms within for example the chairman's annual report
the obsession of current management with measurement and the reduction of every variable to numbers for ease of computer manipulation has worsened the situation 
unfortunately there is no easy remedy 
humanresources are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible to measurement beyond the level of counting heads and trades
key variables such as the quality of staff at any level and the current morale are only expressible in general verbal descriptive terms
it is generally acceptedp # that hygiene type variables such as pay and working conditions can if they are inappropriately specified depress morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high levels of these parameters
morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work in the sense of work variety opportunities and attitudes of management
these factors are worthy of emphasis because in practice they are still dealt with very badly in many organisations and yet it takes little trouble or expertise to make an enormous difference
for example very few senior managements take the trouble to keep workers fully informed about policies and likely changes
the result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious in morale terms
the two human factors which can be unambiguously measured are age and sex
the age distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important source of information
for most purposes a rectangular distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix of youthful enthusiasm and ageing experience
it also makes for regular changes as staff retire and are replaced 
many distributions show a peak in a particular age group mainly associated with taking on a large number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised this is not desirable because it leads to excessive competition for promotion at particular stages 
these comments are obviously most relevant for work forces where there is little tendency to move out this is characteristic of a surprisingly large number of organisations in european countries and in japan but much less so in the usa
stable work forces have their advantages in terms of familiarity with the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result in problems if the market for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable
this is particularly so in high technology eg design and construction of ships aircraft power stations and chemical plant where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive 
some peaks of demand can be dealt with byusing consultants but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation
in well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length of in-house experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirements
given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise
on the other hand if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep staff who have periods with little to do between projects
it is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting staff between design and operational duties
this not only provides flexibility in the useof man-power it also improves communication
these real difficulties of man-power utilisation are such as to force many organisations to become larger and larger if they are to remain economic
size provides a cushion to the vicissitudes of markets but it creates other problems
for example difficulties of communications and in particular how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation
this is considered in more detail in chapter #
humanresources should be fundamental to subjects such as ergonomics which are essentially people-centred but the concept remains procedurally undevelopedat any level from a continent through countries regions and companies down to particular working systems
this is one reason why policy makers never seem to take account fully of the people affected by their decisions
the design of procedures
the increased importance of standardised informational support for both machines and operators has led to the concept of procedures as a separate design issue within a system fig #
much of this information can be incorporated in computer programs but there is also a need for extensive printed paper for the use of the operator
this takes three main forms checklists routines and knowledge-texts
the terminology in this field is not standardised
software might be restricted as in this book to computer programs but it is sometimes usedas the generic term to include all sources of information
procedures is sometimes usedfor what are here called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator's information support except software
the situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself computer-based 
sometimes the term firm-ware is used
however whatever the terminology usedthere is a requirement for design effort
the quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed some simple guide-lines table #
many documents are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in terms of expertise and style of thinking
similarly it is assumed that the conditions under which the reading will take place are the same as those of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office
they may have to be read in the open air in rain and darkness or within a plant under oily cramped poorly lit conditions
the user probably has limited expertise and he may be working under various stress conditions
the material on which the information is printed the typeface used the sequence the structure and the format generally should reflect the conditions of use easterby and zwaga #
all these things can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under the normal conditions of use
checklists
checklists are used in the pre-start mode for routine maintenance and for fault-finding
they normally take the form of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components
the sequence is dictated bythe optimal order in which actions should be taken for example in starting up an aircraft
there are many situations when the order is of no great consequence for example a safety audit of a new machine and in this latter case some logical structure is needed
as mentioned above the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator thinks and acts is different
baker # suggests that four kinds of shortcoming emerge when checklists are validated in the real situation 
the operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks
systematic use of a checklist often reveals faults in work design such as inadequate access visibility and labelling
the checklist itself may be inconsistent incomplete imprecise or ambiguous
finally the checklist may have reprographic limitations such as inadequate vertical or horizontal structure poor typefaces and insufficient linking of requirements descriptions remarks and tick-off points 
the international ergonomics association developeda general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in edholm #
there is a deceptive simplicity about such lists which requires extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content 
the context is of course the context of ergonomics as conceived by the designers of the list
routines
a routine is the most common form of instructional material 
the reader is required to follow a series of steps which might for example introduce a change in the performance of a complex system
normally routines are single chains of instructions although it is possible to have some conditional branching 
each step should be simple and complete in itself preferably with some indication that successful completion has been achieved for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change in the flow of some material
as mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded as a written task description
by definition and design intention routines are inflexible 
the user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction
no great skill or intellectual effort is required which is one way of saying that the human operator is being under-used but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error such as omitting a step or reversing steps 
in general the value of formal routines is precisely that the operator left to himself will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner
knowledge texts
knowledge is contained in documents which may vary from single sheet presentations to large manuals
as instructional material it is indirect in that the reader is not necessarily told what to do as in a routine
rather he is informed about the situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base from which he can work out his own actions
nevertheless the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected
it is too easy to follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake
the need to know criterion is crucial because unless it is applied the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material 
correspondingly the material should be structured in terms of how it is most likely to be used
in this context the operator requires a guide for action and not a scientific text-book
it is invariably better to provide material diagrammatically systematically or at least in well-structured short paragraphs rather than in flowing prose
consider for example how readily information about the relative position of streets is available from a map of a town centre rather than a verbal description of all the streets
such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town
note the enormous flexibility compared with a routine which would tell him only how to get from one particular point to another
a second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary
however the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in making decisions about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance for a particular task which is equally available
thus one would expectthe use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines with the human performance being more versatile but less predictable
with two-dimensional representations such as maps it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main roads and key buildings or other features such as rivers
see for example fig #
manuals which may contain maps schematic diagrams and other materials warrant separate consideration
the design of manuals
a manual is usually in the form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer
it is part of the communication package from the designer to the user
thus it is a particular form of job aid which provides the operator with information on a system and its performance
the standard of manual design has traditionally been very low for several reasons
for this purpose the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely takes the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know
often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out and it is regarded as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work has been completed
the problem is particularly acute for computers
manuals for cars machine tools and so on are poor but at least it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions
most computer operators do not know or wish to know about the mechanisms and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation
the computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual at least in the early stages of gaining familiarity with the system and its functions
he is usually very badly served although the principles of manual design are well known
for most systems the manual is best divided into parts as indicated in table #
the first part should be a general introduction which orientates the readers towards the system its purpose its functional structure and mode of operation and its performance limits 
this should be followed bya separate section on how to set the system up in the first place and how to check that it is working properly
if it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it fix it into position connect it to power supplies and start it up
if it is large the emphasis will be on the start up procedure
the section describing the operation of the system should cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it
extensive useof line drawings schematic diagrams algorithmic lists is desirable and where prose is usedthis also should be structured into short sentences with meaningful separation into paragraphs
the maintenance section should indicate what if anything the operator is expected to do and the symptoms which indicate that more specialist maintenance skills are required
tables subdivided into faults reasons remedies can be extremely helpful
parts lists including description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacements
a standard fault is to assume that the reader is familiar with the jargon which the designer habitually uses
a glossary of terms and acronyms usedcan be very helpful not only to the reader but also to the writer who is forced to consider carefully how he is using various technical terms
finally all manuals should end with an index which supplements the table of contents at the beginning 
the school framework 
a model to link personality characteristics to a preference for science
john head
introduction 
in recent years there has been a steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play a crucial role in determining subject choice and student success
unfortunately this evidence has tended to be fragmentary a collection of separate discrete pieces of information lacking a synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive power 
the few models which have been developedto date may have been correct as far as they go but are clearly incomplete
for example roe # eiduson # and mcclelland # suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships
maslow # and hudson # and # saw science as providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boys moving from the calm of latency to the turbulence of adolescence
even if these descriptions are valid they still leave open a number of questions particularly why the same mechanisms do not operate with girls
arising from the evidence in the literature and from our empirical studies at chelsea college it is now possible to offer a model which is compatible with all the evidence and which also has considerable predictive potential 
what we know about persons choosing science
the evidence for an association between personality characteristics and an interest in science has been more fully reviewed by head #
we need now only take note of the most salient features 
the most obvious one is that of sex differences
the predominance of males particularly in the physical sciences and engineering throughout the western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences which are too small nor to institutional factors
equal opportunity in education and employment has not made science any more popular with women
furthermore the characteristics of those students who do opt for science show clear sex differences
male scientists both science students and mature professional scientists tend to be emotionally reticent disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves and depending upon their partners in personal relationships to take the emotional initiatives
they will also tend to be authoritarian conservative and controlled in their thinking
these differences can be seen quite early on we have found boys aged # years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers
girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid in their thinking although they do seem to have low self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive
we also know that at about the age of # a very high proportion of boys are attracted to science and scientific careers
thereafter there is a steady decline of interest in science and this disillusionment extends right through the secondary-school years and into the undergraduate period
in contrast only a minority of girls express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teens
some further evidence has come from our useof sentence completion tests with secondary-school pupils as part of our research programme at chelsea
analysis of these responses provides further information on sex differences and between those opting for different subjects 
for example girls at the age of # and # years seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationships seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature while boys are more exploitative
in relation to the sentence stem a girl and her mother girls often produce responses like often go through a bad patch for a year but once they learn to understand each other become the best of friends or can help each other with their problems
similar questions when asked of boys tend to produce banal responses or exploitative ones for example the parent is seen as the source of money
in contrast boys seem to have a firmer self-identity and a clearer ambition showing more insight in response to sentence stems such as my main problem is and he she felt proud that
such findings give us some clues about the characteristics of boys and girls of these ages
if we compare boys of # years of age who opt for science with other boys we find that the former have very cut-and-dried views on many issues
for example they take the view that criminals should be severely punished or that anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate
to the sentence stem when a child will not join in group activities these boys gave responses like he is selfish he must be stupid he deserves to be unpopular
in contrast other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways of integrating the child into the group
the science boys seemed to possess few doubts or uncertainties they offered clear-cut answers
it was this evidence which suggested the possible model for subject choice in terms of ego-identity achievement
ego-identity in adolescence
this model was originally postulated by erikson # and then developed by marcia # and #
erikson suggests that at different phases of life an individual faces a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved before moving on to the next phase 
for adolescents the acquisition of a clear ego-identity is the crucial task
at the beginning of adolescence the individual is a within the family and the school
by the end of adolescence he or she needs to make choices about career life-style personal relationships and ideologies
the ego-identity of that person is shaped bythese choices
erikson does not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue
some problems about identity arise with the young child in the context of home and school and others occur in later life for example on retirement
nevertheless adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates the personal development of the individual for a while
the adolescent does not however need to achieve a clear ego-identity on all topics at one time
he or she may have a clear identity in respect to his or her career but still be unresolved in regard to personal relationships and ideology
in this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career
marcia has put more detail onto the erikson model and suggests that in going from the initial ego-diffusion condition to that of having achieved ego-identity two processes are involved and 
crisis in this context describes a period of intensive self-examination in which one's beliefs and values are re-examined
commitment means that the individual has acquired clear and firm beliefs both about himself or herself and the world
figure # indicates a number of possible routes to ego-identity achievements
a person may undergo crisis and commitment simultaneously and progress byroute a an alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination in which all one's beliefs tend to be very fluid a period known as moratorium before acquiring beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved route b
a further possibility is that the individual may at least for a time hold onto beliefs and values taken without question from others for example parents teachers peers
this condition is known as foreclosure 
eventually these persons might have to face up to period of crisis of self-examination and so achieve ego-identity byroute c however foreclosure does offer an escape route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination byclinging rigidly to his or her beliefs and values route d
ego-identity and choosing science
we can now make the link between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in schools
for boys at the foreclosure stage science is likely to be appealing
the physical sciences in particular offer a conventional career choice which is likely to win approval from parents teachers and peers
they will tend to regard the overt expression of emotions including much such expression in the arts as being soft and feminine
science with its masculine image makes little emotional demand on an individual and seems to offer clear precise answers to problems
opting for science will permit and possibly reinforce emotional reticence
for a girl at the foreclosure stage the situation is very different
there is evidence that girls tend to be socialized into adult roles more through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through their career douvan and adelson #
furthermore these girls will tend to go into a career with a feminine image one which already attracts many girls
consequently very few girls at the foreclosure stage will enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model to do so from their parents and their school
neither boys nor girls at the moratorium stage are likely to be attracted to the science that is usually presented in our schools
they are at a stage when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issues the meaning of life the existence of god ideologies their emerging sexuality their future career and life-style too often science is seen as being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute to these debates
science somehow seems to be scarcely relevant to the most important issues in our life
a proportion of both boys and girls at ego-identity achievement stage will choose science
in fact most girls entering science are probably at this stage as they will need some self-examination and sense of commitment to make this unconventional choice
however only a minority of adolescents will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage at the age when most pupils have to make crucial decisions about subject choice at school
this model seems to explain our observations 
a large number of boys particularly at the foreclosure stage are initially attracted to science but there is a drift away throughout later adolescence as they undergo some crisis 
the preponderance of boys at the foreclosure stage will yield the rigid authoritarian attitudes often associated with scientists
the few girls who enter science will not usually show these foreclosure characteristics
effects of curriculum changes 
the real useof this model linking personality development to subject choice is that it allows us to make predictions about how pupils might react to changes in school science curriculum and school organization
we can consider three possible changes 
#
 britain is unusual in asking pupils to make crucial choices about subject options in the #�# age range 
these decisions can only be reversed with great difficulty
what effect would delayingthe choice make 
in the development through the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure pupils will diminish hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut 
more boys and girls will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage and a proportion of these will go into science
overall there would be a reduction in the number of students choosing science but those who so choose will be more likely to stay happily in the subject and to possessmore flexible minds
the quantitative loss would be met bya qualitative improvement
#
 it is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist in showing illustrations of boys rather than girls doing practical work in the laboratory and so forth
what effect would a deliberate attempt to change this image have 
it might make it easier for girls at the foreclosure stage to accept science so recruitment might increase
some of these girls might however drift away again when they reach their crisis period
unless the change in image was immense boys would probably not be affected science would still be an obvious acceptable choice for a boy
overall there would be some increase in the recruitment of girls but no qualitative improvement
#
 to obtain a major qualitative improvement to recruitment in science with more girls and with students possessing imaginative flexible minds it would be necessary to make science appealing to boys and girls at the moratorium stage 
in that event science must be seen to be relevant to the issues which concern them
the probable implication is that science would need to be presented in the context of the needs of society and individuals
probably a case-study approach involving the application of science and the interaction with other disciplines would be needed
our knowledge about the girls' concern with personal relationships suggests that the introduction of some elements of the social sciences into the case studies might prove attractive 
is it possible to change school science in this fashion and still preserve the essential character of science itself
clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning of content
perhaps science teachers should not attempt to cover their subjects so comprehensively
a history teacher is content to cover the history of one country or continent over a few decades
perhaps we must make similar choices
it is interesting to notice that the association for science education # policy statement in britain and the proposals on school physics coming from the institute for science education ipn in kiel are advocating such changes 
the difference is that we are now offering a formal psychological model to suggest that if we want to reduce the current encapsulation of science if we want to recruit a different sort of student then certain curriculum changes are needed 
girl friendly science and the girl friendly school
judith whyte
approximately three times as many boys as girls take o levelphysics and approximately four times as many take cse physics
over # per cent of entries in all technical subjects are from boys
this means that schoolgirls are ineligible for a wide range of courses in further and higher education and for entry to occupations requiring a scientific or technical base 
female exclusion from science and technology even if it is apparently by girls' own choice also means that as citizens their ability to understand and control their environment is limited
nevertheless most schools consider they are already providing equal opportunities byneutral treatment of the two sexes bloomfield #
in effect ignoring the effects of gender in this way merely reinforces stereotyping because it does nothing to challenge the definition of certain aspects of the curriculum as masculine or feminine
girls into science and technology gist was the first major schools-based project addressing problems of sex stereotyping at school and was an example of action research in education the project simultaneously took action to improve girls' achievement in science and technology and investigated the reasons for their under-achievement
the project team collaborated with teachers in eight co-educational comprehensive schools in the greater manchester area to devise and implement intervention strategies designed to improve girls' attitudes to the physical sciences and technical subjects 
two other schools were involved as controls where attitude testing but no interventions took place 
the approach was collaborative teachers were invited to work with the team as equal partners in the attempts both to investigate and find solutions to the gist problem
however very few of the teachers even recognized the issue as one of professional concern at the start of the project and most of the first two years was spent in establishing the educational importance of the issue and working towards the development of feasible intervention strategies
the project and its outcomes have been fully describedelsewhere smail 
# kelly whyte and smail # whyte in press
gist had more success in alteringchildren's attitudes than their subject choices suggesting that it is easier to change attitudes and beliefs than actual behaviour
pupils in action schools became markedly less stereotyped than pupils in control schools
they also had slightly more positive attitudes towards science and scientists and were less likely to define them as exclusively masculine
despite some evidence of change in teachers' attitudes behaviour they themselves were reluctant to admit that the project had influenced them
according to an evaluation report this may reflect an unwillingness to admit that in the past schools have been sex biased payne cuff and hustler #
the gist hypothesis was that female under-achievement in science and technology is at least partly socially constructed by the school an hypothesis based on research evidence as well as critical feminist analysis see for example kelly #
during the project there was a shift away from locating the issue as one of girls' motivation towards attempts to change the nature of school science
one of the main gains from the gist project has been the clarification of what is meant bya girl friendly science that is a science which will appeal equally to the interests and concerns of girls as well as boys 
making science more girl friendly
several interventions were designed to make science more girl friendly
schools and teachers tried curriculum development to build on girls' science interests changing patterns of classroom interaction single sex groups and classes
the largest scale intervention was the vista programme which consisted of women scientists and technologists visiting schools to talk to children about an aspect of their jobs already being covered in the school science syllabus
vista made science more girl friendly in two ways both boys and girls were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist and talks concentrated on social and industrial applications of science an element too often missing from science at school
one school was so impressed by the children's positive reactions that they completely revamped the science work in the first two years to include more social and human applications of science
the survey of children's attitudes helped here research such as ormerod's # ormerod and duckworth # had shown that girls were interested in the social implications of science but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach might be in practice
would science in the home be a starter 
a question from our survey asked children whether they would like to know more about how a vacuum cleaner works hardly anyone did and girls were even less curious than boys
this told us that any simplistic assumptions about featuring female domestic interests in science would probably meet with failure
the rest of the questionnaire about science curiosity showed that all the children were enthusiastic about learning science and that girls were keen to know more about nature the environment and medical science
over # per cent and in some cases over # per cent said they would like to learn about the human heart germs and illnesses how our muscles work what food is good for you life in the sea what makes a rainbow appear and how a record is made
it was helpful that these topics also interested boys
at present the science curriculum is structured around physical science interests on which boys are keener how motor cars work atoms and molecules we were able to recommend that teaching build on the overlapping interests of the two sexes because girls as well as boys want to know more about human biology and spectacular features of the environment animals in the jungle volcanoes and earthquakes acids and chemicals
the less immediately attractive parts of science could be approached through these interests for instance teaching forces bybeginning with the action of muscles in the human arm and light via the dissection of a bull's eye
when women scientists employ such approaches and describe their own work as happened during the vista programme girls are receiving double encouragement
these examples indicate some of the features of girl friendly science it builds on girls' interests not just boys' it explicitly encourages girls to see themselves as potential scientists and it includes some of the social and human implications and applications of science
other gist interventions
all the gist schools were mixed comprehensives and at first teachers were most unwilling to separate boys and girls at all on the grounds that it ran counter to their co-educational comprehensive philosophy
then certain teachers were particularly struck bythe evidence of large differences in the interests and experience children brought with them to school
girls had far less tinkering experience than boys and the connection with their lesser interest in topics like how electricity is produced seemed obvious
several special science or craft clubs were organized in the lunch hour for girls only and in two schools teachers planned single-sex teaching
as we shall see it was in these two schools that the largest measurable changes of attitude and option choice occurred
for a more girl friendly science it seems vital that teachers should come to see that when all the masculine packaging evident in textbooks and resources as well as teachers' and boys' behaviour in the classroom is removed girls can be very enthusiastic about science 
alison kelly sees at least four distinct senses in which it can be argued that science is masculine
first the pupils teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male in terms of numbers second school science is packaged and presented to appeal to boys not girls third classroom behaviours and interaction operate to reconstruct science as a male activity and finally it has been suggested that scientific thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world view 
the gist interventions describedabove relate to three of these vista women albeit briefly and temporarily redressed the numerical balance byoffering female role models of practising scientists vista and the curriculum developmentwhich followed involved a limited repackaging of science to remove its exclusively masculine appeal and the single-sex classes and classroom observation showed how science comes to be defined as masculine in the mixed school
the fourth point the idea that science is intrinsically masculine can be sustained only by clinging to an irredeemably narrow conception of science and scientific thinking
the industrial and social impact of science on health on people on the environment a focus on the beauty and complexity of the natural world are notable omissions from the school science syllabus
girls are not uninterested in science they are bored bythe limited version of it they meet in school
one of the purposes of an extended period of single-sex science teaching might be to let teachers see how girls approach scientific matters and to discover what may well be the case that girls are just as capable of scientific thinking as boys

during the # margaret boushel claire debenham lisa dresner and anna gorbach worked in the london borough of islington within social services for pre-school children
this chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered 
the first section provides an overview of provision and services in #
the next section describes attempts to create a clear under policy
the third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services
the fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services local authority cuts and the demise of the inner london education authority
the chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination
background under- services in islington #
islington is a multi-ethnic inner city london borough with a child population of #
in # # per cent of under fives in islington had the use of an under facility # per cent on a full-time and # per cent on a part-time basis
between # and # provision gradually increased so that by # there were # children's day centres about # playgroups and # assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the social services department and # full-time and # part-time places in nursery schools funded by the inner london education authority
the beacon nursery a local mencap project offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties
unlike council day centres playgroups or community nurseries the beacon nursery was free 
children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand
the beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs
by # it had half that number on roll 
since # numbers at the beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities
in addition the elfreda rathbone organisation a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties
some integrated services emerged in the early # one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative and an integrated adventure playground was established bya voluntary organisation
workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup
in addition to its mainstream schools the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from islington and neighbouring boroughs one for children with moderate learning difficulties one for children with severe learning difficulties one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties one for autistic children and one for children with physical disabilities
in # three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of #
the children usingall of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers
residential units
by # residential services were designed with care in the community in mind but most were based in specialist settings
for example field end house had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties and was designed to offer respite round the clock care
parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home
by # field end had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at leigh road
the social services department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care by # their number had been reduced to eleven none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties
the community health team
the community health team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision
it included physiotherapists occupational and speech therapists doctors psychologists and a specialist health visitor
they were joined in the network by specialist teachers funded by the ilea and based in the special schools who visited children at home before they were due to start school
this group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues
discussion of services to individual children also took place 
this included deciding between day care or school and parents' attitudes to different options
often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action
the community health team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age to enable them to develop to their fullest potential
they were however an all-white group operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to care in the community
they gave support to the beacon and elfreda rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to treat children
because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision
the special services team
in the early # social workers were funded jointly by the ilea and islington social services department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for partially hearing children
these social workers were based in the borough's special services team
they all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered 
they were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability
when a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in # it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs
this might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage 
instead for a number of reasons it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in islington
first the post was not attached to any specialist institution
there was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the beacon nursery
second the worker had an alternative peer group of under workers who were key figuresin controlling access to all other under- facilities
third the worker was committed to the idea that treatmentof a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social emotional and cultural needs
there was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents
attempting an integration policy
the labour council elected in # had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort
this led to the initiation of an under- review
the review team set up under the auspices of the social services committee included councillors senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under social workers in its membership
it proposed a network of under- centres throughout the borough an idea which the under- workers had been anxious to promote for some time
day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information support and resources to parents
the review had made no mention of children with special needs
the specialist social worker and another under- worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children
they interviewed parents specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations as well as by some child-minders
broadly the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice
parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were
many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer
one afro-caribbean woman describedhow she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good
she fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended
because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to have a go and the placement went ahead 
she commented
i had to fight every step of the way for this 
no one told me about it and no one wanted him to have it
i knew it was right for him this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children
it doesn't matter that he's not like them
i know what is right for my child but i'm not supposed to say
parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist therapy time but wanted it to be usedin a more flexible way 
some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs
definitions of special needs varied widely in the questionnaire responses some defining it as children with disabilities some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not english
this made the survey difficult to interpret
the findings were documented in a report ccuf # and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs with suggestions for how these might be overcome
these ideas were informed bya paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local mencap group who had previously tried to generate the debate within the community health service through the mencap committee 
the conference a place for all our children'
as a result of this work the coordinating committee for under fives ccuf an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision
prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate
these included parents under- workers specialist workers children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers
each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending
about # people attended the conference held in april #
workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information
the conference made the following recommendations
#
for a formal universal information system covering local and specialist resources 
#
for children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised
#
for employment of extra staff where needed and employment of peripatetic special needs workers
#
for availability of money for equipment toys and adaptations
#
for enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs
#
for priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision
#
for training facilities for staff in ordinary provision specialist provision and child-minders
#
for greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision
#
for therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children and that for all children including those with special needs their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in islington
it was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health education and social services before they could be implemented
finally it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration none of the recommendations could be effective
ii the first 
unity had been easy during the resistance because relationships were almost always man-to-man
over against the german army or the vichy government where social generality ruled as it does in all machines of state the resistance offered the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal
the psychological and moral elements of political action were almost the only ones to appear here which is why intellectuals least inclined to politics were to be seen in the resistance
the resistancewas a unique experience for them and they wanted to preserve its experience in the new french politics because this experience broke away from the famous dilemma of being and doing which confronts all intellectuals in the face of action
it is only too obvious that this balance between action and personal life was intimately bound up with the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive it
and in this sense it must be said that the resistance experience by making us believe that politics is a relationship between man and man or between consciousnesses fostered our illusions of # and masked the truth of the incredible power of history which the occupation taught us in another connection 
if by # merleau-ponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what was to become sartre's project in the the theoretical problem that followed was how to unite orthodox marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of sartre's earlier work that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one's own freedom how to relocate human practice within historical determinism to reconcile the individual with the social the idea of agency with that of necessity or freedom with history
for marxist or hegelian thought such an age-old contradiction ought to be resolvable through the operations of dialectical logic
citing marx's famous remark in men make their own history but under circumstances given and transmitted from the past sartre suggested that this implied the permanent and dialectical unity of freedom and necessity i #
accordingly he attempted to shift marxism away from orthodox theories of an absolute determinism towards the primacy of a concept of history which while still a totality as it had been for luk�cs a process with a determinate meaning and end could also include a concept of human agency and thus articulate the individual with the social freedom with determinism
today sartre's voluntarism is to some extent returning to favour as the result of a desire to retrieve the categories of agency and the subject which goes together with the wish to get out of the apparently totalizing systems of adorno althusser or foucault
sartre's stress on the role of the subject also finds approval because many of those no longer prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the progress of a single narrative of class-struggle have begun to argue instead for a return of its correlative the subject almost as if it was the next best thing in the absence of history itself
but it still leaves us with the crucial problem that sartre had to solve namely how to link human consciousness with the processes of history so that the former can be said to be the agent of the latter
how could this take place
as sartre had put it in 
never has better understood that he has history and never has he felt so powerless before history
how can man make history if at the same time it is history which makes him
sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism takes the easy way out bymerely eliminating the first in favour of the second making man a passive product entirely determined byeconomic circumstances
unwilling to follow merleau-ponty bydropping the second in favour of the first sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once through the movement of that is intentional actions which produce material effects
its corollary whereby praxis becomes determining history he called the practico-inert bywhich he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been createdbyprevious praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis
the individual is thus both totalizer and totalized deftly uniting freedom with necessity
though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history makes him it does not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the products of individual acts totalizations can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required bythe logic of dialectical rationality rather than being the arbitrary blind and self-cancelling movements of say hardy's immanent will
sartre's fundamental thesis that history continually effects totalisations of totalisations i # does not in itself answer what ronald aronson has rightly characterized as question for sartre how do separate antagonistic actions yield history how do individual totalizations lead to totalization and also progress the direction of history its truth and its meaning
for the whole basis of sartre's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law some powerful unitary force revealing itself behind history like the will of god but the continuously produced effect of individual conflicts each action is in its turn subsumed as a part of the wholein an ever broader developing totalization i #
what sartre needs to demonstrate therefore is that if the law of the dialectic works from the individual level overall it produces nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of history as such
the dialectic is the law of totalization which createscollectivities societies and history realities that is which impose themselves on individuals but at the same time it must be woven out of millions of individual actions
we must show that it is possible for it to be both a and a how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration
i #
but what produces the overall direction of history
how does it continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration
sartre does not attempt to answer this question shifting rather to the notion of a lack of self-consciousness
the dialectic is the law that remains hidden 
at the moment history is made without being known history constitutes we might say today a political unconscious 
marxism on the other hand sartre claims is history itself becoming conscious of itself i # as for luk�cs it is bybecoming conscious of itself as the subject of history that the working class will understand history's meaning and so recognize itself as the meaning of history
while he suggests in apocalyptic tones in that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take place and that civil foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses 
the detour of stalinism is thus formalized as marxism's own descent into its unconscious resulting in a dream-work of heterogeneous histories that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of marxism's own reading of history
it is therefore sartre argues our historical task to make it known promoting not just the historical process as such but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history with one meaning the truth of humanity i #
sartre's account thus sets up the articulation of history univocal meaning and totality as the indissoluble set of elements required for the validation of marxism necessary in order to save it from its detour from itself
the problem however remains how such universals are produced from the multiplicity of initiating individual praxes
if history is a history of conflict how could it be both one and internally diversified without the inner moving principle of the dialectic
how can history be a unity if it is also conflictual if each action is aimed at destroying the other and results in a double negation in which the original aims of each action have been destroyed bythe other
if each action negates the aim of the other where is the unity totalized in the conflict
how does history constantly totalize itself
i # # sartre arrives at what he calls the real problem of history that is how there can be totalization without a totalizer only at the very end of volume i it is not until the next volume however that he intends to show how individual actions separate multiplicities make up human history with truth and intelligibility i #
throughout sartre has nevertheless taken it for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both as history and as historical truth i #
his history therefore is always in process but its teleology of a final totalization always has to be assumed 
he thus asserts the truth of history while constantly projecting forwards and deferring its proof
but when the proof comes it also turns out to rest on the assumption that it is already true 
iii the second 
we are trying to establishthe 
sartre produces a persuasive formulation of the relation of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concepts of praxis and the practico-inert it is also obvious to him how the larger question of history ought to be solved
he asserts it often enough history continually effects totalisations of totalisations i #
but in volume i of the as we have seen he continually defers the demonstration of his proof
for the dogmatic dialectic as he describes dialectical materialism the whole question naturally poses no problem for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already operative movement of totalization that produces them and then goes beyond them
but sartre's dispensing with all historicist schemas createsthe problem of how between two autonomous and contradictory totalizations there could be one dialectical intelligibility of the ongoing process ii #
he attempts to solve this through matching his account of contradiction with a new concept derived from the conjunction of work and labour anti-labour a category of negation 
the products of a conflict as well as its residues may seem incomprehensible insofar as they differ from the original intentions of any of the combatants 
nevertheless they constitute the basis and conditions for further actions and history
dialectical reason encounters such products as undecidables 
 because they seem to be at once the results of a communal enterprise while at the same time bearing witness to the fact that this enterprise never existed except as the inhuman reverse side of two opposed actions in which each aims to destroy the other
in the dialectical perspective we encounter these objects as productions which are human and provided with a future thus they seem bythemselves to be totalizations in process
ii #
this means that first they lead to results and second that the internal structure of social objects contains the double negation of themselves and of each constituent part bythe other ii #
there is therefore before any understanding of historic agents and movements a certain in all social ensembles from afar they may appear whole but close to they can be seen as riddled with holes 
this increasingly comes to resemble nothing so much as sartre's own account of history
in the context of the negativity of this formulation sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such as the dialectic or whether the structure of negation that he has describedmeans that as for adorno or bakhtin history does not develop positively but rather negatively and is therefore instead detotalizing
marxism is rigorously true if history is totalization it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular histories or if in any case within the relationship of immanence that characterizes struggle the negation of each adversary bythe other is on principle 
certainly we have neither the design nor the actual possibility of showing here the full truth of dialectical materialism
our goal is solely to establishwhether in a practical ensemble torn apart byantagonismwhether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced to one the breaks themselves are totalizing and carried along bythe totalizing movement of the ensemble 
ii #
at this point sartre confronts the possibility that the whole project of the stated so confidently on its very first page it must be proved that a negation of a negation can be an affirmation i # may break down 
perhaps the truth of history cannot be proved its direction cannot be discerned 
sartre's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category a unifying force of a singularization which incarnates the universal if totalization really is an ongoing process he writes then it operates everywhere
that means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble and that each singular event totalizes in itself the practical ensemble in the infinite richness of its singularity ii #
unlike luk�cs' insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative sartre's singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal the relation between the two structured according to the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the wholewhile as he puts it the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny
sartre's singular universal therefore begs the question for it is predicated on the assumption that if there is not a totality as such then there already is an overall totalization if totalization really is an ongoing process
that developingprocess is itself totalized through sartre's assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles as it must be if the singular is to incarnate the universal
the concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in the argument whereby sartre can avoid the question which he began byposing
so the singular universal presumes the totalization he can't yet prove
this strategy marks a structure of repetition in sartre's text each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of history without a totalizer he retreats to a more limited example whose unity is already evident but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again
in this case sartre demonstrates how the singular universal works byappealing to the concrete example of a boxing match a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversaries of the master slave dialectic
its totalization takes place through its incarnation as part of the totality of boxing in the overall framework within which each individual fight occurs
each boxing match sartre claims must be both a unique event and also in some sense the incarnation of all boxing whose rules and conventions it follows and whose past and future history it sets itself against 
but it is also apparent that that totality is not completely known nor is its future shape even presumed
bytotalization therefore sartre does not here mean anything like a predetermined end or final closure of a totality but rather a process of mediation among the parts where each is determined by the other
no one can predict the future of boxing either at the level of particular victories or defeats in effect a structure of repetition nor at the more general level of possible modifications or developmentsof the sport
yet each individual bout articulates itself within the framework of the history of boxing known and unknown
this allows sartre to include chance and contingency in his scheme
since it cannot be known as a concept that will realize itself in the future sartre argues instead that the totality only produces itself in the moment the incarnation as such is at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure abstract unity of that which it totalizes ii #
the universal the totality can only be known through the singular
but its future direction remains unknown and indeterminate
at the same time sartre makes a larger though less persuasive claim that the boxing-match also works synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers to be the basis of conflict in general
the boxing match is the public incarnation of conflict ii # totalizing in its own struggle the wholeof contemporary irreducibilities and fissures ii #
thus one can and must say that each fight is the singularisation of all of the social whole in movement and that bythis singularisation it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is
ii #
but then he adds i have said and i repeat that we have not yet proved that this enveloping totalization exists
so although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality insofar as it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination unlike the case of the boxing match where we can define the overall entity boxing it still remains unproven that an overall entity history can be said to exist at all
for all his use of the model of the boxing match sartre has really got no further with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without a totalizer
it is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match takes place within a general totality of boxing which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted according to general rules and a specific social tradition
but what about those conflicts that do not take place within such a constituted social system such as conflictual bourgeois societies which cannot be said to be unified except as sartre suggests dismissively byappeal to a lost paradise before the class struggle 
such societies make the conflicts of history irreducible to sartre's logic unless like the boxing match they can be shown to take part in a larger totalizable category
however when he poses the question of whether his method could work as well for the class struggle as for the boxing match sartre admits that he finds it impossible to answer and returns instead to the much easier case of sub-groups
once again he backtracks and assumes a larger unity in which conflict takes place 
the major question thus always remains unanswered in the every time that sartre announces that he is about to proceed with the fundamental problem of how history can be a totalization without a totalizer he turns back to a previous more easily intelligible stage on the way 
his difficulty is accompanied bya no doubt symptomatic increasing distrust of universals so that in championing specificities against them he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals history as totalization that originally formed the object of his project
at this point a further contradiction in sartre's whole enterprise begins to open up for someone so deeply distrustful of universals it seems curious that he has involved himself so emphatically with the notions of totality history and the dialectic
as sartre insists more and more upon the virtues of specificity ii # # such is his distaste for marxist or any other universalizing categories that he refuses even to countenance them attempting to replace concepts with specificities universals with singulars
his scepticism goes to the extent of even denying the existence of society or the nation as such ii # # the very totalities which his own general argument for totalization requires
here certain similarities with later post-marxist theorists such as foucault or lyotard begin to become apparent
but if sartre anticipates such later thinkers we should not assume too quickly that they have simply taken his insights further 
for sartre's singular universal could never be expectedto solve the formal theoretical problem of how individual existential existence can be related to history insofar as it simply renames in one oxymoronic category the original antithetical terms
without an adequate theory of their articulation they simply begin to separate again
d warfare and crusades
the poet marbod of rennes celebrated in latin the vengeance which would befall a wicked castellan and his troops 
the poem highlights two important twelfth-century developments the useof force in punishing aristocratic crime the fruit of princely peace-keeping and the increasing significance of siege-engines in warfare
intellectuals claimed a formative influence in the second too john of marmoutier declared that monks from his own monastery had read vegetius' to geoffrey le bel when he was investing the castle of a rebellious castellan and ascribed his success to their advice on firebombs
but common sense may have been more important than learning in perceiving the vulnerability of most castles to battering-rams and catapults for even in # they were as a rule primitive structures
siege-engines demanded on the one hand skilled operators and on the other a plentiful supply of unskilled labourers to move the necessary materials
this effectively restricted their use to the wealthy and to those whose claim to assistance under the was incontrovertible
equally the improvements in fortification needed to withstand their effects thick stone walls inner as well as outer defences required incomes greater than those of simple lords
the net effect was that given dedication princes louis vi geoffrey le bel alphonse-jourdain could subdue rebellious castellans within their own demesnes and could build castles of their own which were impregnable to all but lengthy and sustained attack
henry ii's castle at chinon where the treasury of anjou was situated was the model for its generation with its halls upper chambers tower and curtain walling set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the loire
it could be copied only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resources chiefly on defence princes great bishops or in the south especially towns
all others became vulnerable
john of salisbury's comment that not only the towns but also the fortresses of gaul feared henry i of england was revealing of the new situation 
similarly campaigning in the field imposed an increasing financial burden 
the treaty between robert ii of flanders and henry i of england renewed by their successors stipulated that each knight supplied to the english king should bring three horses with him this at a time when a horse represented a major investment
then knightly armour grew more elaborate and costly throughout the century
and though some knights might be supplied free by feudal service household ones had to be maintained by their lords mercenary ones needed pay and those with money-fiefs constituted a regular charge on the treasury
besides away from their home base knights were useless on their own
in open battle and in the plundering expeditions that constituted the normal form of aggressive warfare they needed the backing of archers both mounted and on foot and of numerous infantrymen
the usual source of supply was town militias suger mentions those of rheims ch�lons laon soissons orl�ans etampes and paris in the royal army of #
but they might have to be supplemented by mercenaries from flanders and the low countries where the rapidly expanding population forced large numbers of young men into military careers
in the eyes of the faithful these brabanters with their freebooting and lack of discipline after the end of campaigns were as dangerous as heretics in # frederick barbarossa and louis vii agreed to expel them from their lands
their value in battle shields behind which the knights could shelter before they launched their charge ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them notably henry ii of england
but the hatred they aroused meant that they were liable to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards
inevitably therefore war on the grand scale as fought by princes bore little resemblance in practice to the feuds of lesser men
the divergence was sharpened bythe application of a theoretical distinction the fruit of augustinian theology amplified as the century went on bycanon and roman law reference princes pronounced their campaigns just wars fought against aggressors with the aim of re-establishing peace or public wars declared by a competent authority in the public interest while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace
geoffrey martel had perceived the propaganda potential of public war as early as the mid eleventh century later it enabled henry the liberal of champagne to claim the military service of all lords within his county a reapplication of the carolingian 
so it could be a powerful weapon 
yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially kings whose competence to declare war could not be impugned thus thibaud of blois failed to persuade the monks of marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against louis vi they claimed discretion in the matter and in # the mighty philip of alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against philip augustus through fear that its ranks might melt away 
the contrast with the united front louis vi and his troops presented to the emperor henry v in # was marked
a royal banner now bestowed respectability on a cause kings' wars were assumed to be for the sake of peace even when cripplingly expensive and increasingly savage
this goes some way to explaining why the complicated campaigns within toulouse in the second half of the century were largely fought out under the banners of the angevin aragonese and french kings and why the revolts of henry ii's sons had widespread ramifications
the twelfth century was characterized therefore byfewer but more protracted wars which smouldered for long periods between short sharp bouts of conflict like the war that covered must of the reigns of henry i of england and louis vi of france the one inaugurated bythe great rebellion of # which outlived both louis vii and henry ii or that against catalan claims in the south
into these large numbers of local conflicts were subsumed
the pattern caused problems in that the circumstances which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable yet the moment an opportunity offered princes had to be prepared for invading their enemies there was no time for lengthy preparation
the usual tactic was to march troops across the enemy's territory plundering and looting to take fortified places if the task was easy to obtain allies among the lords of the locality and to retreat without fighting a battle if at all possible in effect an application to a wider canvas of the some technique of warfare which had earlier made castellans formidable in the immediate environs of their castles
it necessitated the rapid mobilization of auxiliaries to join a core of highly-trained troops kept constantly at the ready the princes' military households which became the linch pin of the system 
john of marmoutier's life of geoffrey le bel offers a glimpse of how strong bonds were created between the prince and his followers within the household and how a high level of training was maintained at all times
geoffrey was brought up from infancy with the sons of neighbouring angevin lords on whose companionship he relied
when it came time for him to be knighted by henry i in rouen he set off for normandy with a crowd of these young men about him
in rouen the occasion was celebrated with pomp elaborate dress and a great feast and then the youths all demonstrated their military skill at a grand tournament at which geoffrey naturally won the highest honours
it was within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished that young men learned to identify their vassalage towards their lord as a symbol of their honour that they debated the relative merits of roland's and oliver's way of displaying loyalty and that they learned the finer points of jousting
tournaments were disapproved of by ecclesiastics for they could be both bloody and dangerous
yet they supplied realneeds
that of an instruction in the martial arts compatible with the maintenance of a prince's peace that of an outlet for competitive instincts within the claustrophobic confines of a court and that of display to maintain princely social status
so they flourished everywhere
they offered opportunities for men of skill to acquire great position in the world arnoul of ardres caught the eye of countess ida of boulogne through his exploits and they also conferred lustre on the great geoffrey le bel and philip of alsace were throughout france for their distinguished performances in these show battles
all this formed a background to the first century of crusading and it goes some way to explaining the more secular aspects of the magnetism which drew french knights to take up the cross in their thousands
urban ii launching the first crusade at clermont in # presented it as a natural evolution of the peace movement warriors were to forget their petty feuds and squabbles in a campaign to promote the interests of holy church
the war declared by one whose moral authority was unimpeachable was to free the eastern churches to end muslim guardianship of the holy places to restore jerusalem to its proper state
as princes saw it it was a just war in the fullest sense of the term those who were slaughtered in its battles were regarded as among the martyrs of the church
when raymond of toulouse robert ii of flanders robert curthose stephen of blois and hugh of vermandois responded to the call past and present members of their military households fell almost automatically into rank behind them to test themselves against terrible dangers but also to enjoy the companionship in arms the adventure the deeds of daring which were the stuff of the 
that they shared along with all other participants in the crusade a fervent devotion a conviction that their sins would be forgiven is certain
yet for them crusading necessitated no large leap of the imagination no millenarian vision it was simply a challenging and a deserving extension of their everyday activities
in french eyes the hero of the first crusade was robert ii of flanders
while raymond of toulouse remained in outremer stephen and hugh disgraced themselves in escaping from the siege of antioch and robert curthose no matter how gallant at least in his lifetime failed to impress robert ii's prestige soared to the skies 
he became robert of jerusalem to his contemporaries his deeds were recorded in the his pious bravery totally expunged the memory of robert the frisian's usurpation and after his death his son baldwin vii harped on his father's achievement to justify his substantial useof coercion against the enemies of the church
outside flanders robert's sister's marriage to roger of sicily was a mark of his new position in the world like louis vi's sister's marriage to bohemond of antioch it stretched french kinship connections into the new norman colonies ensuring that travellers from the homeland would find a welcome in those distant parts
robert's example was a potent one
after the next change in dynasty thierry and philip of alsace strengthened their shaky claim to the comital position byattaining for themselves the prestige attached to being the outstanding crusaders of their generation
thierry's remote connection with the family of godfrey de bouillon along with his marriage with sybilla of anjou fulk v's daughter gave him some claim to the throne of jerusalem as a consequence the aristocracy of outremer viewed him and philip with mixed feelings expecting much of them yet fearing their ambitions
in the end it was not in outremer but in the newly conquered byzantine empire that the flemish crusading achievement was crowned with the elevation of count baldwin ix to the imperial throne in #
but in the twelfth century the house of alsace could afford the high costs of their expeditions thierry went to jerusalem four times philip twice and the counts' repeated absences in fact promoted administrative reform the and the were as much the products of crusading as the english and norman judicial system and exchequers were the product of the king-duke's divided attentions
but if on balance the flemish counts benefited materially from crusading as arguably did the angevin they were far from typical
for other french houses a commitment to outremer often represented a sacrifice of domestic political interest
the achievements of raymond iv st gilles in consolidating his authority within toulouse were threatened byhis departure in # especially since it was known that he had no intention of returning home
then his example lured his elder son bertrand to tripoli in # and his younger son alphonse jourdain there in #
had not his grandson raymond v fulfilled his crusading obligation in his early youth thereby freeing himself from the necessity of interrupting his career in the county the principality of toulouse might have disintegrated altogether
william ix's crusade of # brought about serious financial problems in aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in the hitherto stable currency and robert curthose's decision to mortgage normandy to william rufus in order to cover his crusading expenses exacerbated a conflict over the duchy which was not settled until the death of his son william clito in #
all in all it was not surprising that suger mulling over the precedents of early crusading tried to dissuade louis vii from embarking on his jerusalem journey in #
yet the appeal of crusading was if anything even stronger to those aristocratic houses just below the level of the princely it was after all the house of boulogne which produced the first two rulers of jerusalem
the counts of nevers the lords of montpellier the lords of amboise and lusignan the trencavels were fervent devotees of the ideal so the problems of absences shipwrecks death abroad plagued them as much as their princes
on occasion their determination to sacrifice for christ played directly into their overlord's hands as when the count of la marche who had no direct heir sold his county to king henry ii in #
when it did not accompanying their princes in a joint crusading venture as the lord of amboise accompanied fulk v or hugh vi de lusignan william ix created new personal links 
the political spin-offs from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate than at first glance they might appear 
nevertheless it is clear that the chief gainer was louis vii
the irony of this lay in the fact that the second crusade was counter-productive in outremer embittered relations with byzantium and resulted in the deaths of enormous numbers of its participants particularly those drawn from the non�aristocratic classes
yet it consolidated the king's position within france partly through the skilled regency of suger but also because in taking on himself the leadership of the expedition louis re-emerged as a credible ruler of men
his noble gesture appeased those churchmen who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over the archbishopric of bourges
the disasters that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma even the barons of outremer continued to look on him as their one potential saviour
his friendship with raymond v of toulouse a fellow warrior reversed the trend of history since the middle of the tenth century in bringing the princes of the far south back into the king's 
the crowds of burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him on their return they sought the arbitration of the royal court in their disputes and they welcomed louis's intervention within the counties that fringed the duchy of burgundy
as william of st denis put it 
even as early as # it was apparent that the crusading movement had provided a new sense of aristocratic cohesion in the realm
the great joint expeditions the combined leaderships although not without friction had been justified bytheir outstanding achievement the conquest and maintenance of jerusalem
they were the the deeds of the franks or the god's deeds performed through the franks as two of their earliest chroniclers entitled them
but what was missing before # was a clear sense of who the franks were
the second crusade however was launched with st bernard's ringing appeal to the count and barons of brittany 
in taking his place at the head of the second crusade the decisively hastened the transformation of the franks into the french

the philosopher's child
judith hughes
some of our children are missing 
children have served philosophy very well
that is the first thing which anyone surveying the literature would notice
along with a selection from a list including women animals madmen foreigners slaves patients and imbeciles children have served in that great class of beings the not-men in contrast with which male philosophers have defined and valued themselves
unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumedthat in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention
they have receivedit in the shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood
generations of philosophers have documented this process
perhaps the best known versionis shakespeare's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to come 
education was to guide the infant through the transition to manhood including such stages as childhood boyhood and youth
that is the second thing to notice the philosopher's children are boys
the fact that at least half of the world's children would not actually go through this process beyond the first two stages is conveniently forgotten or ignored and no doubt the reasons for this were largely social
but the neglect of girl children through the centuries of theorising is more than a social injustice though many might think this real and bad enough
education has an end 
although it is fashionable to talk about its value for its own sake what prompts the theorising is the strong and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns out to be
where the end is personrather than role that is where the end is the developmentof the human mind and spirit rather than the production of say information technologists then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve 
such an ideal does not stand isolated from the practices which strive towards it but interacts with those practices helps to construct them and is in turn constructed by them
the great philosophers have always produced such a person-oriented account at least for those whose education was thought to matter
education has been directed at the production of the rational the free the independent of mind the dignified in short the autonomous human being
yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male his children boy children and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species
rationality turns into narrow intellectualism freedom into licence independence into isolationism dignity into selfish pride the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social atom after all
the degeneration occurs not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow libertine isolated or selfish but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others
it is a curiously paradoxical foundation uponupon which to build a theory of autonomy 
moral autonomy is concerned with individuals not with groups a conception of autonomy which depends upon group membership displays its own contradiction
this paper is partly about the rejection of certain accounts of autonomy though not with the rejection of the ideal of autonomy itself
it is also about children
women philosophers and girl children
why should women in general and women philosophers in particular be specially interested in the nature and status of children
there are of course the familiar and obvious reasons connected with women's traditional role in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too
when philosophers dismiss women as not-men they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics
explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that women children or lunatics or whichever other company they keep 
it would be well to know just what this entails 
schopenhauer said that women remainbig children alltheir lives it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like
a common result of this is that when the philosophers deny autonomy to women they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it to children and cite lack of rationality capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristics
we can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves we can ask further questions are children like this is this why children are not autonomous 
again women well know what it is like to be treatedas children and they find it offensive 
it would therefore be reasonable to consider whether children find it offensive to be treatedlike children
is being treatedas a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience
what is it to be treatedas a child
women philosophers are in a special position to consider such questionsfor in the image of the philosopher's child they see themselves
it is no accident that the liberation of women such as it is should form part of a wider movement of liberation in general liberation for one part of the not-men is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow groups are sometimes quite literally identifiedwith you
the assumption that all groups in the not-men class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that as we shall see in the fourth section it is readily assumedeven by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that for example some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children
that's what they used to say about women is not a proof that saying it about a child is false 
but it should make us very suspicious
that when women are given the vote it follows that children should be given it too is no argument at all but a version of it occurs in modern debates over the justice or injustice of mill's famous disclaimer in his essay 
having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with the liberty of another except on the grounds of self-protection mill # asserts 
this principle is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturityof their faculties
we are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood
those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury 
p#
this view as we shall see has been attacked on the grounds that it rests on the false assumption that the distinction between adults and children is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational beings
the attacks are based on empirical observation most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational
if we agree that in that case women should be embraced bythe liberty principle then so should children
i shall suggest that this does not follow because rationality is not in fact the grounds for the distinction in the first place 
partly to redress the balance and partly because talking about children covers such a wide range of potential images i shall try to keep before my mind an ordinary #-year-old of our society
she is the child of this paper unless i indicate otherwise
throughout we should ask ourselves does whatever is being said apply to 
first of all let us remind ourselves of the traditional picture of children drawn for us by some great philosophers of the past
one thing they are all quite sure about is that children are not like adults in particular they agree that children lack some capacity for rational thought which adults have 
now we are # or # or #
the slave has absolutely no deliberative faculty the woman has but its authority is imperfect so has the child but in this case it is immature 
aristotle #a
children are not endued with reason at all tillthey have attained the use of speech but are called reasonable creatures for the possibility apparent of having the use of reason in time to come 
hobbes # p #
children love to be treatedas rational creatures sooner than is imagined by which
i mean that you should make them sensible by the mildness of your carriage and the composureeven in your correction of them that what you do is reasonable in you and useful and necessary for them
locke # p #
in training for youth the child must be given reasons in the training of the infant for childhood this cannot be done
young children ought merely to have things shown to them as they are or they get puzzled and ask question after question
but as we approach the age of youth reason appears 
at what age ought the education for youth to begin 
roughly at the age of ten years when bynature the child enters the stage of youth and begins to reflect 
the youth is capable of having principles his religious and moral ideas can be cultivated and he is able to attend to his own refinement 
kant # pp #�#
if a society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children incapable of being acted on byrational consideration of distant motives societyhas itself to blame for the consequences
mill # p #
what are the philosophers' children like
they have an immature deliberative faculty aristotle are not endued with reason hobbes until roughly the age of # kant and are incapable of being acted upon by rational consideration of distant motives mill
but they are not completely lost causes 
the immature deliberative faculty will mature children have the possibility apparent of turninginto rational beings hobbes they love to be reatedas though they were rational though they are not so yet locke you can give the prerational child reasons for acting in certain ways and he will turninto the youth who is capable of having principles kant
until the time when these things happen then mill's disclaimer comes into operation
children must be taken care of by others and protected from external injury and against their own actions 
the traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous that is on a standard interpretation they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goals 
it is then a matter of preference whether you say that they cannot choose the goals or that they cannot form strategies to achieve them or both
in either case the political implication is that denying rights to children is entirely justified and there the matter rests 
in all this there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher's child with our mental picture aristotle's observation that children are immature and mill's suggestion that they might need protection
beyond that the similarities seem remote 
there is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle
apart from being false such an account leaves no room in our thinking about children for things like teaching and learning or development in understanding and character and all those other concepts which refer to processes and not to states
the tension between these theoretical views of children as non-rational non-autonomous beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in those quotations from hobbes and locke and kant and mill
children according to hobbes have the possibility apparent of becoming reasonable
in what does the possibility consist
hobbes is not usingan inductive argument here the possibility apparent is not an inductive argument from observations about past children but is meant to refer to some discernible feature of present ones
but what
hobbes does not tell us but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have 
it is not language since hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child
perhaps it consists in the ability to respond intelligently to the language of others
but then either hobbes has failed to distinguish the child from at least the higher and domesticated animals or the force of intelligently must be explained in such a way as to exclude animals
in any case if such a qualification is called for it is hard to see how a creature with no rationality at all could possess it
locke's remarks are just as puzzling
children are definitely not rational but love to be treatedas if they were
how is this possible
apparently they like having things explained to them without understanding either the explanation or even what an explanation is
perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice
well maybe they do but making any old noises is clearlynot sufficient to enter the rationality stakes i must at least something
is it just that i talk to them that they love
maybe but i can also if i like talk to my car but yelling at it in the approved basil fawlty manner is hardly treatingit as rational
lockean children have the added amazing ability to recognise reason in you without possessing any themselves while kantian kids two stages back from rationality have the disconcerting habit of getting puzzled and asking questions
mill's minors are a little more complicated
part of the time he sees them in the familiar way as creatures who lack rationality to at least some degree 
but in the disclaimer his children need above all to be protected from the ghastly consequences of their own actions
their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose goals or to form strategies for achieving them but an incorrigible propensity to choose the wrong ones and an awesome efficiency in achieving them unless adults intervene
all in all it is a pretty unconvincing picture 
if you say that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational and to do that it appears from these examples that you have to assume that they already are
if on the other hand you allow rationality to children then you cannot use their lack of it as a criterion to distinguish them from adults
hobbes 
are not aware of the unreality of their original pictures which is why often in the same sentence they produce these contradictions
the one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale signs of forgery 
illegitimate inferences
the recognition that children cannot simply be written off in the rationality stakes and cannot therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they cannot therefore be denied it on any account 
we should notice that this view is not just a flight of fancy from the loony left the pederast lobby or children themselves
it is also to be found in stronger or weaker versions of more cautious academic thought
in # john holt notes that children are in fact capable of a great deal more than modern society allows them to be
he sees childhood as a fairly modern invention designed to fit adult rather than children's needs and an oppressive invention at that 
he suggests that children should be given a comprehensive range of civil and legal rights including the right to vote to manage their own financial affairs to direct and manage their own education and to control their own sex lives and 
to make and enter into on a basis of mutual consent quasifamilial relationships outside one's immediate family ie the right to seek and choose guardians other than one's own parents and to be legally dependent on them
holt # p #
this is also the view put forward by john harris though in less specific terms
like holt harris believes that the so-called incompetence of children is an adult invention imposed on children for adults' convenience
he makes a firm proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced to # years and remarks
we must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult not to mentionthe which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add 
perhaps we should conduct annual examinations from an early age to be sure that we do as littleof this sort of damage as possible
harris # p #
now holt and harris both have many wise enlightened and humane observations to make about some of the injustices which we inflict upon children but as these remarksshow putting them right without inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter
both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental myopia in imagining the consequences of such proposals and i am not here referring only to mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions
what we may ask holt happens to the child who dissatisfied athome seeks in vain for guardians who would suit him
what if no one wants him
our papers are currently full of hard children in local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parents
in such a situation the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product of success for some children is not the total destruction of self-esteem for others
what we may ask harris happens to the child who repeatedly fails his annual examination
to impose such a test on children would be a particularly invidious way of discriminating against them unless harris has in mind that we should all undergo such examination
he might then be open to bitter objections from many adults
these two suggestions far from being enlightened liberation of all children are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to at least some and harris's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise 
in any case it would be dishonest to pretend that mill-type consequences are not relevant here 
suppose holt's #-year-old does opt out of school
what happens to her then
what happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her
is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead
however much she may enjoy such pursuits there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied
given that holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her who will
his view that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide
holt's child is actually the artful dodger mercifully not all children are
there are other difficulties too
it is not clear whether or not harris thinks that children of # should be obliged to take on full political status whether or not they want to but holt clearly does not
he proposes that the rights privileges duties responsibilities of adult citizens be made to any young person of whatever age who wants to make use of them holt # p #
if holt thinks that this proposal would remove an arbitrary boundary line between adults and children then he is mistaken
the point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights privileges duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them
he may not exercise his rights or he may shirk his duties but he cannot forgo them
they are not just to him they are his
that is what being a citizen involves 
rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children
holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do and then leaves it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise them
but the same cannot be said for duties and responsibilities
failure to exercise one's rights may be morally neutral failure to carry out one's duties is not
it would be perfectly possible to give the rights to children without imposing the duties on them the one does not entail the other but we would then still be distinguishing between adults and children as citizens
children still would not have full political status
duties and responsibilities are not merely to a citizen they are an integral part of being a citizen
holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the rights so that he can remark
i do not say either that these rights and duties should be tied into one package that if a young person wants to assume any of them he must assume them all
he should be able to pick and choose
holt # p #
if he can pick and choose i suggest he is not a citizen he does not have full political status and he is quite distinguishable on these grounds alone from the adults around him who do not have this option
holt and harris both in the end face the same problem
they attack the status quo by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are reasons and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all
whatever else such a strategy may achieve it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which unless they can be defended gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness
when in doubt go back to aristotle
the trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense 
that it is firmly tied must be correct the inhabitants of brave new world are not autonomous precisely because they are denied access to relevant information
relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy but it is not synonymous with it
aristotle said something very interesting in that extract from the which i quoted earlier he said that women have a deliberative faculty but that it lacks full authority 
what did he mean
revival under law #�#
few contemporaries would have expectedbalfour's retirement to lead to a unionist recovery 
the party was in a mutinous condition in november # and there was no apparent successor who would have even half of balfour's political gifts 
nor was it clear that balfour's departure was universally desired at the national union conference a few days later leo maxse was booed off the platform and constituency parties everywhere passed resolutions regretting balfour's decision
a great many crocodile tears were shed for since unionists had such an elevated view of the principle of leadership they were unable to acceptthat they had just driven their own leader from office
the shock caused by balfour's going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affairs of the party with less friction than had been fashionable of late
the main contenders for the leadership were austen chamberlain and walter long representing the two different establishments of the edwardian unionist party the opposite worlds of birmingham and wiltshire but the situation was complicated by the intervention of two outsiders edward carson and andrew bonar law
two strong groups emerged behind long and chamberlain about equal in numbers but there were few backers for carson or law
carson thereupon fell out of the contest or rather announced that he was not standing for no official nominations had been made 
the party officers and whips were solidly behind chamberlain but law drew off some of his support among tariff reformers and urged on by edward goulding and max aitken he refused to withdraw unless his continued candidature would allow long to win
against chamberlain it was remembered that he was a liberal unionist as was lansdowne who led the unionists in the lords and that he had not been entirely loyal to balfour since the referendum pledge 
long was supported by the bulk of the english county members but by few of the party's men of talent
by the morning of friday # november it was clear that neither chamberlain nor long would secure a majority and that some supporters of each of them would not contentedly follow the other
a party meeting was to be held on the following monday and the whips were making preparation for a vote to be taken 
chamberlain provided the way out by suggesting to balcarres that both he and long should withdraw and so allow law to be elected unanimously he also turned down balcarres's remarkable advice that he should allow long to be elected since long would make such a mess of things that chamberlain would be bound to succeed within the year
faced with chamberlain's proposition and without a majority of his own long had no option but to agree
bonar law backed by fewer mps than any of the other three contenders at the beginning of the week was now to be the unanimous choice
robert sanders reported the election meeting on # november with evident satisfaction
the carlton meeting on monday went off quite admirably
harry chaplin in the chair a very great success
a good many men came into the room by no means inclined to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement 
walter long proposed bonar law
his speech was one of the best things i have heard
manly and rather touching
the country gentleman at his best
he spoke and evidently felt strongly of the degradation that it would have been to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot
austen followed 
when austen sat down chaplin suggested that he had better put the question at once and on getting an affirmative shout did so
a clever way of stifling discussion and few could have done it so well
motion carried unanimously
bonar law then sent for
his speech struck me as the feeblest of the day
he was evidently moved and nervous
the meeting separated in great content with the conservative party all round 
it was certainly creditable
the urgency of the events following balfour's resignation was due to the need to find a new leader before the national union conference
so within a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues law's leadership was ratified by the throng of party notables at leeds here he received a reception more typical of what was to come in the future
in # law was known in so far as he was known at all in the parliamentary party as a spirited debater
a
p taylor has noted that law was trained if he was trained for anything in his early career to be a debater
in glasgow he had picked up many of the skills that a more highly-born politician might have acquired in the oxford union or at the bar but skills that were very different in appearance 
his concern was solely with effectiveness rather than style he rarely spoke with more than brief notes and left it to the occasion to furnish the words
when he became chancellor of the exchequer this practice caused consternation at the treasury when he used only a page of notes to assist him in moving complicated resolutions on wartime finance he relied successfully on his memory to provide details and figures
as an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to his audience's reactions and so convey the impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousands
in parliament he was wont to abandon an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point had been made the speeches that appear in hansard were touched up by his staff and his speeches in the country were given to the press in advance 
in debate he was a formidable opponent and one that asquith was never able to master for all his forensic skills
again law succeeded by unorthodoxy he was quick to grasp the essentials of an opponent's argument and quite prepared to be rude or direct if the situation demanded it
in the long debates over marconi in # and over the curragh mutiny in # law was able to nail asquith's evasions where a more polished stylist might have been foiled
occasionally in the onrush of pursuit he gave commitments that were later regretted but these were a small price to pay 
the unionist recovery was built around law's leadership but what asquith called the new style of obstruction threats and offensive behaviour did not originate with law
the beginnings are to be found in the diehard campaign against the parliament bill
it was in june # that the first scenes of disorder were mounted in the house of commons led by lord hugh cecil
in august # the diehard peers used language as violent as any that law was to use later and in the crucial decision on the house of lords law sided with the hedgers rather than the ditchers 
ulster's opposition to home rule long pre-dated law's leadership and he had rarely even spoken on irish affairs in parliament before becoming leader
before he succeeded balfour then law was not associated with any of the features that were to characterize his party leadership his contribution was to use the leadership in the service of all of these causes to make himself the spokesman for the most spirited sections of the party
law conceived of the role of the leader in an exactly opposite sense from balfour he sought to foster unity by placing himself at the head of the discordant elements where balfour had thrown the leadership on the side of restraint 
their respective positions explain this in part as ex-prime minister and a considerable figure in his own right balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party as the tertium quid in the recent contest law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view 
his strategy was rather to canalize the enthusiasm of the diehards into party channels to articulate their views and to create unity from the sense of movement 
in his characteristic phrase i am their leader i must follow them but he determined to follow them from the front 
as a result of this he was labelled as a diehard and a bigot when he actually distrusted the diehards and was himself distrusted by the bigots
much of his leadership was thus a form of pragmatic extremism extreme action and the threat of more extreme action to come but used in the cause of more limited objectives
he certainly held deep convictions as to the absolute wrongness of the liberal policies that he opposed but at least a part of his apparent hostility was assumed for the occasion a hard line that might secure a better compromise in the end 
so in his first major speech as leader in parliament he wasted little time on the customary compliments and warned the government that he intended to play hard 
in private conversation he told asquith i am afraid that i shall have to show myself very vicious mr asquith this session
i hope you will understand
in later conversations about ulster law was frank enough to point out that bloodshed in ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral landslide for the unionists
there was then an open toughness about party tactics before the buckingham palace conference in # he had central office work out the electoral effects of excluding nine six or four counties of ulster from an independent ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot
from the party viewpoint law's methods were successful but dangerous expectations raised when the party was in full cry were not easily set aside for an eventual compromise and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the recovery of power 
the basis of recovery was then law's fighting capacities as leader
in parliament there would be a carefully organizedcampaign of resistance that would at least slow the government down and raise unionist morale
improved morale would also make possible organizational advances outside parliament all linked to the issue of ulster and with the sights fixed firmly on the next election an election that would make or break the union the empire and law's leadership of the party
all was linked to the sense of a new departure a new style a new regimein politics and a new team at the helm as well as a new leader the party had by the middle of # a new chief whip party chairman party treasurer principal agent press adviser and an almost entirely new team of whips and organizers
party organization provided the easiest advances because it was the only area entirely under the party's control 
no general election was fought by the organization set up after # but there is little doubt that there was a massive improvement criticisms that were commonplace in # were not to be heard by #
the space available to central office was increased by the acquisition of st stephen's house as well as st stephen's chambers which had been occupied since # the new office cost # a year in rent alone 
the quality of the senior staff was improved by the appointment of three specialists
john boraston took over as principal agent in # having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to the liberal unionist council
he joined william jenkins appointed chief organizingagent in # and previously district agent for the midlands liberal unionists
the party was indeed handed over to birmingham
finally malcolm fraser ex-editor of the standard and of the daily express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently was employed to run the press bureau at the colossal salary of #
steel-maitland boraston jenkins and fraser made up a team of experts all of sufficient status to deal with politicians who might call into the office the work of the office was departmentalized for the first time and the heads of department brought together into a supervising board
the influence of central office toned up the rest of the organization
a new canvass system was introduced in # so that all county constituencies would operate the same system and so that duplicate records could be kept at area level 
this was important at a time when outvoters were a larger group in many constituencies than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly unionist
in # a register of car owners was compiled also important when some voters could cast several votes in an election when polling went several days
by november # only fifty-one constituencies in great britain were without candidates a much better position than the position at dissolution in either # or # few of these fifty-one constituencies were winnable but in any case most of them had candidates by the end of #
a programme of speakers for a general election was also ready by # with both constituencies and politicians told in advance what they might expect 
the financial mismanagement that had reigned before # was ended with the employment of professional accountants
expenditure on central office district offices and the london office doubled from # in #�# to # in #�# the total expenditure of the party organization from central funds also doubled from # to over #
to pay for this outpouring a great drive was mounted for additional income -by farquhar and steel-maitland
in # ordinary subscriptions still brought in only # a year and it proved difficult to raise them to anything like what was needed
the method adopted was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to bring in a regular income and both balfour and law were used to raise the wind 
steel-maitland told balfour that farquhar and i are endeavouring to raise more money
i think we are likely to succeed thanks in part to the very generous example set by lord rothschild
but i would b e very glad if i might see you on your return to ask you to help me in two cases
systematic collections were made from peers and from the city by the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted to # twice the sum in # and worth four years expenditure and there was a special cash deposit of # for the coming election
in three other areas as much political as organizational advances were made towards the management of the press the coordination of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party and the fostering of modern attitudes in the local parties
under malcolm fraser the party began to make effective use of its support in fleet street
it had been recognized that liberals had been more adept at handling the press because they were more ready to stoop to newspaper practices as sandars had reported in #
i told northcliffe that if his people would make enquiries at our central office he would find that our nightly regiment of speakers was at least as well worth reporting as the radical contingent but that i realized that from the press point of view no doubt our speakers did not play up to the reporters by handing them their speeches in advance and by other tricks of the kind to which the radical orators have recourse
this was the essence of the problem the press could only be managed by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to central office to search for news
the uoc found that it is patent that some feeling exists among the unionist press that while in the past they have done much for the party the party has not assisted in their work
in many quarters it is asserted that the unionist press are treatedwith greater courtesy by the radicals than by their own side 
fraser dealt with this problem without difficulty and explained to law in # that the importance of getting important speeches in advance is shown in concrete manner by your wallsend speech on october #th
the verbatim reports reached most of the newspapers in places such as aberdeen at one o clock in the morning of the #th
he went on to quote the response that had been receivedfrom editors
manchester dispatch i hope you will continue this form of enterprise
you fully know as an old pressman the difficulty of dealing with a big speech late at night
daily express i am much obliged to you for the precis of mr bonar law's speech last night
it was a great help to us
the speech came over the wires so late and the sheets were so confused by the post office which is usual in these cases that without the precis we could not possibly have got the leader throughin time for the first edition
so in the supply of information to newspapers predisposed to support the party much was achieved merely by employing a specialist
the other side of press management depending on informal contacts is less easy to assess 
in # steel-maitland invited blumenfeld of the daily express to central office for a two-way exchange of ideas and advice
he also used law himself to impress editors who were on less familiar terms with fraser as with marlowe of the daily mail and law took a direct interest in negotiations with the most difficult of all the unionist editors j l garvin of the observer
law personally conducted the negotiations with gardner sinclair over the sale of the observer and the pall mall gazette in # this negotiation also demonstrates that as well as producing information and nursing editors the party had to work hard to keep some of the newspapers in business
sinclair did buy the observer and the pall mall in the end but not before he had been given a # guarantee from party funds
such investments had a double purpose for they could bring in income and provide a political bonus 
one such scheme involved the purchase of the daily express by max aitken with party funds but the party was also propping up the globe the standard and a wide range of provincial dailies
all these transactions were secret for there would be little use in keeping a paper alive if it were known to be owned by a political party
the papers were therefore bought through nominees or bank loans backed with party capital
it was usual to extract some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from being enforced
sinclair thus gave an undertaking that his papers would always remain unionist but steel-maitland doubted if such a promise had any value 
the later history of the daily express suggests not when the express became hostile in the # younger raged when i think of the large sum of money this office has put into that gutter print it makes my blood boil 
the justification for pouring out large sums without a certain return was the even greater cost of any real alternative
the support for the express in # provides for the introduction of # or # to retain the only half-penny paper the party possesses in london and no less a sum than # to # # would be necessary to start a similar paper if the daily express were allowed to go 
the struggle therefore went on to keep the unionist press alive and in # and # both aitken and northcliffe stood by the party and gave valuable support in their papers
the coordination of competing party bodies was carried out with surprising ease
the national union was merged with central office in # and fusion with the liberal unionists followed in #
joseph chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled by austen and by the overwhelming wishes of the liberal unionist council to merge
to cater for all susceptibilities the party became the national unionist association of conservative and unionist associations a decision that allowed some local parties to go on calling themselves conservative but the name liberal was at last dropped 
the liberal unionists were admitted to the carlton club and a longstanding source of tension was eradicated
this was in itself a striking commentary on what had already been done liberal unionists who had resisted amalgamation under balfour and acland-hood in # acquiesced meekly under law and steel-maitland in #
other organizations could not be absorbed but could still be brought within the central office orbit 
so in # steel-maitland offered to join the halsbury club in order to guide it on to safer lines and was immediately accused of disloyalty by walter long
long helped though by placing both steel-maitland and boraston on the executive committee of the union defence league for the same purpose
steel-maitland also explained to lord robert cecil that it has been arranged that the national conservative union should send out leaflets produced by several of the ancillary organizations such as the tariff reform league the anti-socialist union the primrose league the london municipal society etc
the central office attitude was flexible for outside bodies would always exist and could even be made use of
they represent a time when either their objects were not the same as those of the official organization or the cco was not enterprising enough to suit them
but some caution should be observed 
it may be wise while retaining or regaining control to trade under different names
in some cases additional subscriptions may be obtained in others full responsibility may be avoided 
with open allies like the primrose league the case for collaboration was strong for the first time in thirty years of existence the primrose league formally linked itself with the party in #
on the other hand the independence of the tariff reform league was a positive advantage after january # the party supported the tariff policy but was not including them in its immediate programme so that central office could continue to distribute tariff propaganda from the trl without compromising party policy
in general efforts to ensure better coordination were a matter of the patient building up of contacts although the improved party morale and the greater efficiency of central office had removed their justification for existence
twenty-eight
nairobi
we start with a young man thomas fairfax in military khaki and flying jacket climbing into his old biplane and taxiing down a runway
he adjusts the flaps zips up his jacket pulls down his goggles
the runway is simply a strip of grass cleared of rocks
the plane lurches into motion
it bounces alarmingly as it gathers speed
a few africans clutching sticks and wearing skins watch the plane as it turns pauses and then accelerates leaving a cloud of dust
the plane climbs reluctantly one set of wings dipping drunkenly 
soon it is passing over the spectacular rift valley
there is no sign of civilization but herds of zebra and wildebeest and clumps of elephants marble the valley floor 
ol doinyo lengai
a group of masai is clearing stones from a stretch of grassland in the shadow of the mountain of god
a large white cross has been painted roughly on the ground
claudia cohn-casson is sitting under an enormous african fig tree near by at a camp table spread with a somali cloth
she has in front of her a typewriter her recorder and her notes
a servant is preparing lunch on a fire
claudia hears something
she looks up into the sky in the direction of ol doinyo lengai
we catch sight of a small plane circling the mountain
it dips its wings in acknowledgement of the landing strip and circles preparing to land
claudia stands up
she checks her appearance in a mirror hanging on a tree
with her lower lip she tucks the upper lip into her mouth for a moment
she is wearing a long fitted skirt of khaki
she adjusts her hat a round bush hat and walks towards the makeshift landing strip
the plane is taxiing pursued by a group of running masai warriors glorious in their red and purple robes ochred hair lion head-dresses and so on
claudia walks over towards the plane
she holds her hat on her head with one hand
the plane is still now surrounded by the warriors
fairfax is securing its wheels with rocks
he looks up to see her approaching
behind her is ol doinyo lengai
its strange shape has become familiar to us
his face is still dirty from the dust and oil except that around his eyes is a white patch where the goggles were
the masai begin to sing
it is a strange other-worldly noise
claudia and fairfax approach each other
the moment is unnaturally poignantly delayed
in his uniform jacket unzipped he is handsome and smiling
the singing of the masai and the overwhelming landscape are thrilling
claudia and fairfax come closer
she is serene
he is perhaps surprised by her composure
she kisses him three times
i am so glad you came
her accent is very french but she speaks english fluently 
anything to help a friend
fairfax is awkward
he would like to say something more graceful 
your face is dirty
you look how you say a raccoon 
fairfax laughs
he wipes his face with his sleeve
sorry
i have prepared the lunch
she touches his arm lightly
they start to walk the short distance to her camp
the throng of masai surrounds them
her servant brings a bowl of hot water for fairfax
he washes his face
the masai watch all this 
fairfax and claudia sit down on camp chairs
the masai stand a short distance off curious but self-absorbed
what would you like to drink 
can you manage a brandy and soda
i think so
she speaks swahili to the servant
now do you want to tell me all the facts
as far as i know them
yes
the masai who has been arrested tepilit is from this district
these people are from his engang
he was supposed to deliver a bull to the district officer it was about three weeks ago and he decided at the last moment to replace the bull with another one
but the district officer miles turnbull would not accept it
her face as she removes her hat and begins to speak is startlingly beautiful although not conventionally
fairfax watches her
as she talks the servant brings the drinks and then the lunch a grilled fowl with some preserves
as she speaks we see a masai market
spread around are hundreds of masai men and women
some of the women are in robes of blue others are in brown dyed skins
the older men have blankets loosely slung over their shoulders
almost every man is accompanied by a goat or a cow held on a short leather thong or controlled by a thin stick
those animals are accustomed to the masai
there is incongruously an open car to one side of the market
from it into the colourful throng appears a young british district officer miles turnbull
he is carrying some papers and is accompanied by two askaris with rifles and an interpreter dressed in khakis
the askaris wear military sweaters sam brownes shorts and socks
on their heads they wear fezes
the whole thing was ridiculous and tragic 
this man was very much liked by the masai
but he was overworked
he had to collect the cattle and make sure that every boma was contributing his fair share
his district stretches nearly one hundred and fifty miles
i liked him even though he was a little bit boring
he was so english
he could not speak masai so he always was accompanied by this man a nandi who i am afraid does not speak masai very good 
very well
sorry
very well
so the laibon's son from up there up the valley past lengai he is a descendant of mbatian the great laibon he tries to persuade turnbull to let him take out his animal from the ones which have been selected 
the young warrior tepilit is arguing with the district officer
he is still vividly scarred from his recent encounter with a lion
his face is painted and he is carrying a spear
on his head he wears a head-dress of lion mane
turnbull explains through the interpreter that time is short it is late there is a great war on with the germans
he cannot wait for the proposed exchange of animals
but he tries to be reasonable
how long will it take anyway
tomorrow it will be ready
i will bring it
it will be too late
tell him that i am very sorry but i cannot make exceptions
he has had plenty of time
the masai warrior tepilit is excited
a number of other masai gather round
he says that this particular animal is a favourite
he strokes its side which is white and marked with round patches of black islands on a na�vely drawn map 
it is a beautiful animal with huge curved horns
i will bring you two cattle tomorrow
i will go now and deliver them myself to narok
tell him i am very sorry but i must fill the quota
turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated
take the animal now he says to his assistant gently
as they move forward tepilit without warning hurls his spear at the district officer from a few feet away
it is a heavy weapon
between the knife-shaped iron blade and the tapered tail of the spear is a rounded handle made from a particularly hard tree
this piece of wood passes right through turnbull so that he is skewered
a fountain of blood at first pours from his chest but soon subsides become a steady trickle
tepilit watches as the district officer performs a brief hokey-cokey before falling face down
this drives the spear almost completely through his body
nobody moves
the watching masai begin to walk away after a long contemplative moment
they seem to be weighing the incident carefully in their minds
the askaris panic
they cock their rifles and fire into the air
now they guard the body which is motionless in a lake of blood that is rapidly drying drunk by the thirsty insatiable soil
you can almost hear the soil gulping 
tepilit drives his bull away
he walks without a backward glance
he has in one hand a stick and is followed by a thin dog
this little group begins to mount a hill
nobody makes a move to stop him
the strange singing of the masai rises 
from a distance we see tepilit walking steadily towards ol doinyo lengai with his animals
they are tiny figures in a huge landscape
fairfax has finished eating but claudia's food is untouched
the next day he presented himself for arrest
did you know this man
i knew his family well
did you see him after the killing
he came to my house and told me what had happened
and you told him to give himself up
of course
what else should i do
i'm just asking
if i can do anything i must know the facts
the facts are not so clear 
this man tepilit was injured helping me with the filming of a lion hunt
now i must help him
when is the trial
it's not arranged yet
but i have tried to talk to him to persuade him to say that he thought the askaris were going to shoot him or that it was a misunderstanding but he refuse absolutely to excuse himself
i'll talk to him
i'll talk to the dc
i heard about the lion hunt
sounds a bit of a balls-up
a balls-up
it was worse than a balls-up
it was a disaster
his brother was killed
all for a film
and that bastard do you speak french leavitt walked away very happy
he was the producer
he was an exploiter
he didn't care about the masai
he wanted blood any blood
lions masai all equal
why do you think he did it
the moran i mean
i don't know
there is a pause
shall we take some coffee now
claudia summons her servant who brings a coffee pot
i'll go and see him tomorrow
don't worry 
the jail at ngiro narok
it is a small police post with cells at the back 
in front of the building is a row of white-painted stones and some cactus-like sisal plants forming a circle around a patch of grass
in the middle of the grass is a flagpole from which the union jack hangs
a car pulls up outside
an askari salutes as fairfax steps out of the car in uniform
he enters the building
a young white policeman appears from his office reluctantly
he straightens up and salutes fairfax
sorry major
i'm sergeant jeavons sir
major fairfax
i want to talk to the masai man you are holding 
i have the papers
are you the defence sir
no i'm here to make a report to the governor
the sergeant's face is elaborately composed 
in a bare mud-walled cell sitting on the floor is tepilit
he does not appear to be disheartened
he looks at fairfax without fear
from behind the sergeant an askari shouts at tepilit
stand up man
attention 
fairfax speaks to tepilit in maa
i hope you are well tepilit ole saibol
then he turns to the policeman that's fine sergeant
you may leave me here
fairfax shakes hands with tepilit and sits on small stool
tepilit squats on the floor
how are you
i am fine 
what age group are you
botorok
is your father the laibon
yes
he is descended from mbatian
you have killed a lion
hooh
i am praised because i held it by the tail
does your father have many cattle
we are owners of many cattle
i am happy
do you know me
you are the friend of claudia from the government 
i am a friend of claudia
i am a soldier
at the moment as you know the white people and their friends are fighting with the germans
this is a very big war
our people also fought the germans
your people fought very bravely
the masai are brave
we know this 
we honour the masai above all people
what do you want to discuss
i am here because i was asked to come by claudia
she wants me to talk to you
there is no need
i have told her everything that happened
she is unhappy
she does not want you to be tried by the government
we are betrothed
she is my little heifer 
fairfax is stunned 
it takes him a moment to regain his composure
you are going to be married
she must first ask her father who lives far away 
do you realize what will happen to you if you are tried
tepilit makes a gesture by placing his hand to his throat and cupping it
i can't see any point in that 
when you killed the district officer it was an accident
i killed him on purpose
what i want to say is this there was a misunderstanding
i will tell the government
you thought the nandi the fat belly wanted the askaris to shoot you
no
i did not
the white man told the askaris to take my animal after i had offered to exchange it
he took my best animal even though i offered two in its place 
that is why i killed him
and now my family have offered forty-nine cattle to his family but the government will not take them to give to his family in england
white men have different customs
they don't like cattle
some like cattle
i have many cattle on my farm
are they milk cattle living in a house as i have heard
not all
many are masai cattle
tepilit ole saibol i have a heavy burden 
only you can help me
i have to talk to the governor
i have to explain to him what happened
the nandi man has run away frightened
i can say to the governor that you misunderstood the order and tried to defend yourself
not the district officer's order but the translator's who spoke too fast without proper consideration as nandi people do and the askaris pointed their guns at you
you threw the spear wildly
unfortunately the district officer stepped forward
if i tell him that they will fine you
many of my people saw me
they know that i killed him on purpose because he took my best animal
if you say that at your trial they will kill you
i have offered cattle to his family
i can do no more
fairfax stands up
think about what i said
i will come back 
go in peace
please god
tepilit does not stand up
he seems content
the sergeant meets fairfax outside the cell
all right sir
not really
has he made a statement
yes sir
he admits killing the do
no excuses
can i read his statement
i'm afraid it's gone off to the high court sir
you haven't got a copy here
we haven't had any carbon paper for two years sir
was it taken down by a policeman
yes sir
by me sir
do you speak masai
no sir but we got the larusa translator in
he's the official police translator sir
we read it back to the man twice
it took me most of a whole day sir
in the cell tepilit sits motionless on the floor
at claudia's camp it is almost evening
the light in the sky is there by courtesy of the vanished sun but the tops of the mountains are still golden honey had been poured lightly over them
fairfax's car appears the lights hopping and bouncing down the track
claudia rises
fairfax steps out of the car
claudia comes to greet him and kisses him lightly on both cheeks
how was he
stubborn
he would not agree
no 
would you like something to drink
they are approaching the fire
fairfax stops 
he told me you two were pakiteng little heifers 
it's true 
i didn't know what it meant 
i did not take it seriously
did you accept any gifts
he was very sick after the lion got him and he gave me his necklace
he was in a fever
i had no idea he wanted me to marry him when he has his head shaved
what a balls-up
claudia the problem is that one masai cruel as this may sound is not considered very important
i have flown my plane with cadged army fuel six hundred miles
i am supposed to be at ghq
they won't hold up proceedings while we talk to him
i've only got until tomorrow
please tom
she touches his arm
please tom
it is completely crazy
there's a war the germans are trying to kill every jew in the world and you are going to hang one masai because of a misunderstanding
there's no misunderstanding unfortunately
he seems determined to die
determined to die
can you talk to his family
i will try
i will also get the translation of his evidence
maybe i can put some doubts into the governor's mind about its admissibility
a boma near ol doinyo lengai
fairfax and claudia are meeting the masai
they are sitting on stools in the middle of the cattle enclosure talking to tepilit's father sentue
around them graceful masai women in long leather skirts are sweeping the boma and plastering the huts with cow dung
in the distance we can hear cowbells
sentue is a grand dignified figure of about sixty-five
he is wearing a blue tunic and around his shoulders is a fur cloak made of the skins of the hyrax
in his hands he holds a snuff box shaped like a small quiver and a thin stick
two warriors one of whom is saibol tepilit's younger brother stand at a distance
sentue is speaking
it is clear that he has been speaking for some time
we have many problems with the government
they want to take our cows to pay for the war
we give them our cows
every time they collect our cows they promise to give us something in return but the next time ask for more cows
our cows are our life
i am a rich man
i have many cows and many children
i have offered many cows to pay this man's family
but the government wants to take away my son also
why do they do this 
this is the way our law is
you cannot kill a man deliberately
if you have been reasonable if you are offering your own wealth two cows instead of one and he will not listen if he thinks you are a small man and will not listen to your suggestions why not
you must kill him
you can't kill a white man in this way 
a white man has blood red blood also
the white man has blood
that is true 
but the white man does not believe that cattle are payment for taking someone's life
the masai sentue finds this hard to believe
he turns his old head wearily as if to indicate to his family the kind of people he has to deal with these days
claudia speaks your son must say it was an accident
major fairfax will speak to the government
i told my son only trouble could come from being your pakiteng
the old man says this without rancour
it is in his mind a fact
claudia is upset
she touches fairfax's arm for support 
fairfax shouts you are a stupid man
this woman has come from far away to write about your people
she did not understand what your son wanted from her
why does he want to marry a white woman
does he think she will spend the rest of her life milking his cows and goats
don't be stupid 
sentue takes a few moments to reply
there is nothing wrong with milking cows and goats
claudia interrupts
ole sentue i agree with you
i have to go to my country to see my father
i am sure he would wish me to marry with someone in our tribe
but in any case i cannot marry your son
in our country to exchange gifts does not mean the same thing 
i was a stupid woman
i did not understand
because you have come here my son is going to be killed
hanged a chicken by his neck in town
no no please
major fairfax will help him
but he must help himself
she is weeping
fairfax approaches very close to the laibon between them
the laibon speaks to claudia ignoring him
how can fahfakhs save him
your people do not believe it is right to offer cows to his family
fahfakhs said that 
they want to kill him
he did nothing to them but they want to kill him
i have looked at the stones
they will kill him
fairfax grasps the old man by his wrist
laibon great-grandson of mbatian you must think again
the white people are having a war with the germans
the masai have been good friends
the government will help your son but he must not say that he killed the white man on purpose
ole sentue simel you must speak to your son
the laibon simply looks down at the floor of the boma
he is not prepared to discuss this dishonourable argument
his face is adamantine
claudia rises
she offers her hand in the masai manner her head bowed
stay in peace
tom we must go
go in peace
they leave the boma
the laibon stands to watch them go
they walk together towards their car
there are tears in claudia's eyes
she turns to fairfax
he will not talk to his son
he strides stiffly and angrily 
claudia you are supposed to understand them
what can he tell him
can he say to him you must stop being a masai
you must tell lies like the muzungus
i will try to get him off 
but i'm not so sure now if it's possible
you must do it tom
my work here will be finished if he is hanged
i can't support it
it's too terrible
they climb into the car and set off
behind them ol doinyo lengai is catching the late afternoon sunlight
they drive down into a dry watercourse and are surrounded by hundreds of cattle returning from their grazing driven by children and young warriors
they cut the engine to allow the animals to pass undisturbed
claudia sits with her eyes downcast
a child greets her but a young warrior strikes the child with a stick
my heart is breaking she says
fairfax turns to her
her face is shaded from him in the failing light
i will do what i can i promise
she kisses fairfax
they sit in the dust of the vanished cattle
claudia you are beautiful
you look so beautiful
i can't bear it that you are unhappy
did you love him
i have to ask
you know that is an impossible question
in one way i loved them all
i have lived here for nearly five years
sometimes for many months i was the only white person for hundreds of miles
i was very grateful to him
i was guilty because he was nearly killed
another man was killed in the ridiculous filming
i believed i owed him some debt
that boy will do anything for me even up to getting himself killed by a lion
so i loved him
yes i loved him but i loved him in my masai self
do you understand me
do you know what my professor said
he said that the most important thing in the world i mean our world is to live 
i believed i was the first anthropologist in france to understand what this means 
i was trying to live the real masai life 
is that possible
obviously not
but at least i was not trying to stand completely outside this life with my little notebook
i can't leave this district with one man hanged and another killed and somehow because of me
i can't
my life would be finished 
you have to help me tom

steady currents 
#
the basic equations
in this chapter we shall be concerned with phenomena in which the main role is played by the current of charged particles
all our variables can be functions of space but are independent of time
it is easy to present the relevant equations we have all of eqns # -# but have to substitute a at = o yielding [formula] 
there is a difficulty with eqn #
it is correct for most of the chapter with [formula] taken as a constant but breaks down for ferromagnetic materials which will be discussed in section #
all the other equations are all right but will not necessarily provide the simplest starting point for solving a given problem
we shall therefore introduce a number of alternative formulations 
first we could search for some analogue of the potential function which proved so useful in electrostatics
we found there that bychoosing a scalar function in the form [formula] we could automatically satisfy the other equation for the electric field strength [formula] 
can we do the same thing for the magnetic quantities
no but we can do a similar thing 
since it is the equation [formula] that needs to be satisfied we should choose the potential as a vector called not without logic the vector potential defined bythe equation [formula] 
substituting the above equation into eqn # we get [formula] or usingthe vector relation eqn a# we obtain the modified form [formula] 
this equation can be further simplified to [formula] bychoosing in the physicist's jargon this is called choosing the gauge [formula] 
can we do that 
one can't usually assign some arbitrary value to the divergence of a vector function 
in the present case however we do have some freedom of choice
the definition of a byeqn # is not unique
if we add to a the gradient of a scalar function the resulting vector a' still gives the same magnetic field because [formula] 
hence a suitable choice of will ensure that [formula] 
so we are left with eqn #
if the current density is specified eqn # will provide the solution for a from which b can be determined
how can we find a solution for a
there is nothing easier
we only need to remember the differential equation for the scalar potential [formula] eqn # and its solution in the form of eqn #
byanalogy the general solution of eqn # is [formula] 
a simple integration will yield a if j is given 
we shall go through a number of examples later
for the moment let us use the above expression for deriving biot-savart's law 
first we shall assume that the current density is confined to a thin wire in which case the integration variable may be changed to [formula] where s is a vector normal to the cross-section [formula] is the area of the cross-section and di is an elementary vector along the tangent of the wire
noting further that js = i and that i must be constant along the wire we may write eqn # in the modified form [formula] whence the magnetic field strength is [formula] 
we have to stop here for a moment to sort out the coordinates
as may be seen in fig # the coordinates of the wire element are x' y' z' whereas the coordinates of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field are set of coordinates
thus the curl operates on the coordinates of p but not on those of dl leading to [formula] where ir is the unit vector in the direction r and we have made use of the vector relation a# in the appendix
this is biot-savart's law derived directly from maxwell's equations
are there any other ways of determining the magnetic field 
well one can useeqn # as it is but very often one is better off byusing its integral form that can be obtained byintegrating both sides of eqn # over a surface [formula] 
byusing stokes' theorem for the left-hand-side and recognizing that the integral of the current density gives the current the above equation reduces to [formula] where the line integration is along the curve c enclosing the surface
the positive sense of the integration path is defined relative to the positive current direction according to the usual right-hand convention 
equation # is known as amp�re's law 
we have now a number of equations describing the same thing
which equation should we usein a practical case the equation for the vector potential amp�re's law biot-savart's law or attack directly maxwell's equations
it's hard to tell 
experience with practical calculations helps but even after years of work one usually remains this side of infallibility
i regret to say that there are no general guidelines available
if one manages to find the simplest method at the first attempt that can mostly be attributed to good luck
can we claim then that the vector potential is as useful as its scalar counterpart in electrostatics
for computational purposes the answer is an unambiguous no
it is always laborious to find the components of a vector so we are not much better off with a than with h or b it turns out however that a is a more basic quantity of physics than b since b is given bythe curl of a it is possible that a is finite while its curl is zero
interestingly under these conditions a has an effect on certain quantum-mechanical phenomena
it would be unfair both to the vector potential and to quantummechanicsto say that none of those formulations have engineering applications in fact the most sensitive magnetometer built to date is based on that kind of theory but by and large engineers wouldn't lose much sleep if the useof a were banned with immediate effect 
the vector potential is not a popular variable among engineers maybe because it is not directly measurable
there are no instruments capable to measure the magnitude or direction of a
in my opinion a is a useful thing if used with moderation
it helped us to derive biot-savart's law it will come handy later in solving certain radiation problems and it often leads to nice formulae eg for the magnetic flux crossing a surface defined as [formula] that may be rewritten in terms of the vector potential as follows [formula] where c is the curve enclosing the surface
we have now collected a good number of formulae which will serve us well in the following sections 
before going on just a few words about the classification of steady currents 
it may be roughly divided into two parts magnetostatics and the rest
we shall discuss the rest first sections #�# and that will give us some idea of the relative significance of electric and magnetic fields 
sections #�# are concerned with magnetostatics where electric fields are assumed to be zero and the interrelationship of j h and b are studied 
since we have so many variables and since in each physical configuration only some of them appear we will record just for this chapter the non-zero variables in each section heading 
#
the defocusing of an electron beam j e d p h b
we have so far talked about positive and negative charges about point charges and distributed charge 
i shall now introduce the concept of an elementary charge # � # c carried byan elementary particle called the electron
this is not a necessity
it is possible to study electromagnetic theory without ever mentioning the word electron but since it has become such a household word and is used so often we can just as well make use of it
in the present section we shall consider a cylindrical electron beam of radius a in which the charge density is uniform p = po and all electrons travel with velocity v
we are not going to enquire into the details how such beams can be produced it belongs to the subject of physical electronics we shall acceptthe fact that the beam exists and will try to work out the forces on the outermost electrons
there is now cylindrical symmetry and a net charge per unit length [formula] yielding for the radial component of the electric field [formula] 
the magnetic field may be obtained from amp�re's law eqn # as follows [formula] where the line integral is taken over the circle of radius a fig # i is the total current of the beam and [formula] is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the cylindrical coordinate system specified by[formula] 
from eqn # we get [formula] 
the electric force on an electron of charge e travelling at the edge of the beam r = a is it is in the radial direction pointing outwards
the magnetic force is perpendicular both to the direction of motion +z axis and the direction of magnetic field [formula] direction
the vectorial product v x b gives an inward force in the radial direction
hence the net force on the electron is [formula] 
noting that [formula] and anticipating the relationship [formula] to be derived in section # we get the following formula for the force [formula] where c is the velocity of light
it may be seen from the above equation that the magnetic force is negligible in comparison with the electric force unless the velocity of the electron approaches the velocity of light
thus the conclusion is that owing to the repulsive forces between the electrons a cylindrical electron beam is unstable 
usinga technical term borrowed from electron optics we could say that the electron beam gets defocused
the other conclusion as far as it is permissible to generalize from a single example is more important in principle
it is concerned with the relative magnitudes of electric and magnetic forces 
since charged particles rarely travel close to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic forces are byorders of magnitude smaller than the electric forces 
why is it then that we have no difficulties in practice in observing magnetic fields 
the reason is of course that there are two kinds of electric charges and their effect usually cancels so the small magnetic field has a chance of getting observed
and that brings us to the ext example 
# pinch effect j h b
in contrast to our previous example we shall now investigate a cylindrical beam consisting of two kinds of charge carriers negative electrons and some positive particles which i do not wish to be more precise about at the moment
we shall assume that the two kinds of particles have equal densities and move in opposite directions
as a result there is no net space charge and hence no electric field 
the currents on the other hand do not cancel because they represent opposite charges moving in opposite directions remember minus one times minus one is equal to plus one
the magnetic field strength is given again byeqn # we only need to substitute for the current in + ip where the subscripts n and p refer to negative and positive particles respectively
hence the magnetic force on the electron at the edge of the beam at r = a is [formula] and on the positive particle is [formula] 
note that the force is inwards and in the same direction for both particles
let us distinguish two cases 
both particles are mobile
in that case both of them will move inwards under the effect of magnetic force 
but if the diameter of the beam is reduced eqns # and # tell us that the forces are even larger 
what happens then 
if everything was uniform then the beam diameter would go on decreasing
in practice however the beam is not uniform and does not possess perfect cylindrical symmetry
under these conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated and of course our model is unable to predict the detailed behaviour of the particles
nevertheless a few qualitative conclusions may be drawn without doing any further mathematics
if the cross-section happens to be smaller at a certain place then the forces are larger there than at the neighbouring cross-sections so the beam will be further constricted etc leading to the sausage instability fig #a
if the magnetic field happens to be larger at one side than at the other side then the beam will be deflected towards the weaker field which makes the field even weaker etc leading to the kink instability fig #b 
the positive particle is immobile
in practice this means that the positive ions are part of the crystal lattice 
there is then no magnetic force on the ions only on the electrons
so the electrons want to move inwards but cannot because the ions hold them back byvirtue of their electrostatic attraction
naturally if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well ie owing to the magnetic force on the electrons there is also an inward force upon the ions
so the whole crystal structure tries to contract or in other words the material is under pressure see example #
in any practical situation this pressure is small and can be neglected when calculating the forces on current- carrying conductors 
#
flow patterns and ohm's law j e d
up to now we have not enquired into the question of how the current arose 
we just assumed that certain charge carriers moved with certain velocities
now we shall say that in a class of materials the current density at any point is proportional to the electric field in mathematical form [formula] where [formula] is the conductivity of the material
the above equation is spite of its utmost simplicity represents an extremely good guess
it is valid for nearly all materials up to quite high electric fields 
will there be a magnetic field 
yes of course whenever there is a current there is a magnetic field as well
but the effect of the magnetic field upon the motion of the electrons is nearly always negligible one exception causing the pinch effect is mentioned in the previous section 
thus we may safely ignore the magnetic field when determining the lines of current flow 
we are then left with only one equation [formula] or [formula] or [formula] depending on our preference
eqn # tells us that there is some analogy see example # with the electrostatic case treatedin chapter #
we may in fact reinterpret any of the diagrams of figs # -# byassuming that the whole space is filled with a material of conductivity [formula] and the field lines are now the lines of current flow as well
is the analogy perfect
not really because # as current flows there is some potential drop in the electrode itself # zero conductivity for part of the space cannot be electrostatically modelled since there are no dielectrics with er = # and # when current flows through two materials of different conductivity there is generally a surface charge at the boundary see example #
it is not worth discussing any of these complications because one is rarely called upon to work out lines of current in a conductor 
we shall rather return to a very simple geometrical configuration for deriving ohm's law 
we shall take a piece of cylindrical material of length l and cross-section s and apply a voltage between the ends
the electric field is then [formula] the current density [formula] and the current [formula] 
from circuit theory [formula] where r is the resistance of the material
comparing eqns # and # we get [formula] 
since [formula] is bydefinition the resistivity we get the result you learned in school that the electrical resistance is proportional to the resistivity and the length of the sample and inversely proportional to its cross-section
a more general definition of resistance valid for varying cross-sections may be easily arrived at but it is hardly worth the trouble 
the essential thing is that the relation [formula] is equivalent to ohm's law 
risking the dismay of circuit engineers some theoreticians do in fact refer to eqn # as ohm's law 
prologue
post-impressionism royal academy of arts london #
he signed the friends' book in his elegant handwriting alexander wedderburn january #nd #
she had said peremptory as always that he was to go straight to room iii where the miraculous stuff was to be found
early
so here he was a distinguished public man also an artist of a kind stepping obediently through room i french # and room ii british # and # on a lead grey morning to the pale grey classical quiet place where the bright light shone and sang off pigment so that the phrase miraculous stuff seemed merely accurate 
on one long wall hung a row of van goghs including an arles poets' garden he hadn't seen before but recognised from small photographs from charged descriptions in the painter's letters
he sat down and saw a bifurcated path simmering with gold heat round and under the rising spreading blue-black-green down-pointing vanes of a great pine still widening where the frame interrupted its soaring 
two decorous figures advanced hand-in-hand under its suspended thickness
and beyond green grass and geraniums splashes of blood 
alexander was not worried about whether frederica would turn up
she was no longer in the habit of being late her life had schooled her to temporal accuracy perhaps to being considerate
he himself at sixty-two felt not quite accurately that he was now too old too settled to be put out by her or by anyone else
he thought with warmth of her certain approach 
there had been a pattern an only too discernible repetition in the events and relationships of his life into which she had ruggedly refused to fit 
she had been a nuisance a threat a torment and was now a friend
she had suggested that they look at van gogh together setting up another form of repetition deliberate contrived and aesthetic
his play the yellow chair had first been presented in # he did not like to think too closely about it as he did not like to think too closely about any of his past work
he stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirlof yellow brushstrokes a viridian impasto a dense mass of furiously feathered lines of blue-green isolated black pot hooks the painfully clear orange-red spattering
he had trouble finding an appropriate language for the painter's obsession with the illuminated material world 
he would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible drama of the painter's electric quarrels with gauguin in the yellow house in arles the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel the asylum fears
at first he had thought that he could write a plain exact verse with no figurative language in which a yellow chair was the thing itself a yellow chair as a round gold apple was an apple or a sunflower a sunflower
sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes as it were in this naked way so that his earlier thoughts of this garden had to be undone the idea of black wings to be stripped from the painted leafage the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed off the notation of geraniums
but it couldn't be done
language was against him for a start 
metaphor lay coiled in the name sunflower which not only turned towards but resembled the sun the source of light
van gogh's idea of things had also been against him
the yellow chair besides being brushstrokes and pigment besides being a yellow chair was one of twelve bought for a company of artists who were to inhabit the yellow house the white walls of which should blaze with sunflowers as the windows of gothic cathedrals blazed with coloured light
not only metaphor cultural motif immanent religion a faith and a church
one thing always linked to another thing 
as the poets' garden a decoration for the bedroom of the poet gauguin was more than it seemed
some time ago i read an article on dante petrarch boccaccio and botticelli
good lord it did make an impression on me reading the letters of those men
arles #
and petrarch lived quite near here in avignon and i am seeing the same cypresses and oleanders
there is still a great deal of greece all through the tartarin and daumier part of this queer country where the good folks have the accent you know there is a venus of arles just as there is a venus of lesbos and one still feels the youth of it in spite of all
but isn't it true this garden has a fantastic character which makes you quite able to imagine the poets of the renaissance strolling among these bushes and over the flowery grass
the youth of it alexander thought
i thought i was world-weary then
in july # two years after writing this van gogh had shot himself inefficiently in the groin and had died slowly
in # alexander a time-obsessed man had read the centenary edition # of the letters
he had himself been rising thirty-seven and when the yellow chair was put on had passed that age was older now than van gogh as he had in the # realised that he was older than keats
he had felt perhaps briefly the power of the survivor 
what nonsense
the eternal youth of provence
he thought of thick fat hot motorways carving up that land
he turned his attention to the timeless fields of wheat and olives
she made a kind of progress up the palladian marble stair
a painter stopped to kiss her a journalist waved
john house who had organised the exhibition came almost leaping down the stairs accompanied by a smallish woman in a pine-green tent coat
he also kissed frederica and introduced the woman fumbling her name as a colleague and frederica as frederica you must forgive me i never know what name you re working under women these days are so protean
frederica did not attempt to ascertain the fumbled name having given upinterest in stray new people until it was clear that they were of real concern
she assumed wrongly that john house's colleague was an art historian
the colleague looked at frederica with an apparently absent-minded scanning attention
john house spoke of the history of the gathering of the images an emptiness here jacob wrestling the angel an unexpected illumination there 
frederica listened attentively went on and signed the visitors' book
frederica potter radio # critics' forum 
she negotiated a free catalogue
she made her leisurely way towards where she had told alexander to be
an old woman armed with a sound guide became quite excited and pulled at the arm of another
 hey look at that winston churchill painted that the carefully cap d'antibes
frederica dipped round her to stare claude monet au cap d'antibes par vent de mistral
a whirl of blue and rose for in less formed plungings of water and wind
 to paint she remembered from proust's description of fictive elstir that one does not see what one sees
to paint light and air between ourselves and objects
 i said dear winston churchill the second woman tugged free of the clutching fingers
 not to be mentioned in the same breath with she said looking nervously from frederica to painted signature
the arrested water shone and danced 
in the catalogue john house quoted monet's description of the painted light around the snowy haystacks an enveloping veil 
he also quoted mallarm� i think that there should be only allusion
to name an object is to suppress three-quarters of the enjoyment of the poem which is created by the gradual pleasure of apprehending it
to suggest it that is the dream 
it was not a view of things with which frederica was entirely in sympathy she liked naming names
but she looked briefly down dazzled by the flowing skin of worked and delicate colour the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea the prismatically sliced frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stacks
she scribbled words notes in the margin of her catalogue
daniel bought a ticket and paid for the hire of a catalogue he wasn't sure why
he had come he believed because he needed to discuss certain administrative problems with frederica
he was aware that she believed he was in need of art
under his arm he carried a folded newspaper with that day's headline peace mother dies
he was raw to bad news more raw as he grew older which was not perhaps quite what he had expected 
he saw and did not see the paintings
there was a field of poppies and corn which reminded him only of small and large faded and ghostly versions of van gogh's harvest which he had seen repeated in endless hospital corridors waiting rooms school offices
he had seen these ample fields as he had seen cezanne's geometric brown and green undergrowth in more than one mental hospital day room
odd he thought considering van gogh himself had died mad and despairing in such surroundings
not serene overexcited these fields
daniel's patience with the nervously ill was not what it had been
although he was fourteen years younger than alexander daniel too was in the habit of thinking of himself a survivor a battered and grizzled survivor 
alexander saw her coming towards him
a dozen or so schoolgirls were dutifully filling in xeroxed hand-written one-word-answerable questionnaires
alexander always a connoisseur of garments realised that frederica had changed her style that the clothes the young creatures were wearing could be described as a parody of the clothes frederica had worn at their age and that frederica's new style was not unrelated to this shift
there she was in a conventional two-piece suit fine dark wool muted geometrical pattern in greens and unexpected straw browns caught in at the waist still very thin to give the effect of a bustle the skirt long and straight to the knee
she had ruffles not swashbuckling at the neck and the small velvet hat could but did not support a veil
the pale red hair was in a figure of eight chignon in her neck reminiscent of one of toulouse-lautrec's fine-drawn cafe habitu�es
fifties and post-impressionist thought alexander connecting 
she came up and kissed him
he remarked on the parody 
she took the point eagerly
 my dear i know
pencil skirts and batwing sweaters and spiky stilettos tottering with their hard little behinds sticking out and all that red lipstick
i remember when i thought lipstick had gone forever a dream of painted excess as i thought paper taffeta had gone forever in cambridge when we all took to glazed cotton
do you remember
 of course
 do you remember the eclectic sixties parodies when we went to the national portrait gallery everything from swamis to major-generals and major-domos too
these are such a serious and uniform parody 
more and more of the same
more of me
 l�se-majest�
and you
you have reverted to type
 oh i'm in my element 
i understand the fifties
i couldn't do the forties bit at all padded shoulders and cr�py things ugh and pageboys i think it must have been purely oedipal those were my parents' things dammit what i was getting away from 
this is my scene 
 so it is
 and now i have money
 in our new austerity you have money
 in our new austerity i am old enough to have money
they saw daniel advancing
 daniel doesn't change said alexander
 sometimes i wish he did said frederica
daniel did not change 
he wore the same black clothes baggy corduroys heavy sweater working-man's jacket that he had worn through the sixties and seventies
like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black fur had been extravagant but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard and his body was still compact and very heavy
he looked in this setting a little some painter 
he saluted frederica and alexander with his rolled newspaper and said that it was cold outside
frederica kissed him too reflecting that he was dressed like a man who smelled dirty but in fact didn't
alexander smelled still of old spice and a sort of agreeable toastiness
his smooth brown hair was as thick as ever but shot now with needles of glittering silver 
 we must talk said daniel
 first you must look at the pictures
take time off 
 i keep trying
i went to the king's carol service
 good for you
frederica glanced shrewdly at him
 now look at the pictures
gauguin's man with the axe
 one for you said frederica to alexander still skimming the necessary accompanying print
 androgynous
john house says
no gauguin said
do you think
alexander considered the decorative gold body itself a repetition of a body on the parthenon frieze
he saw a blue loincloth flat breasts purple sea with coral tracings lying flatly on it
he was unmoved though the colours were rich and strange
he told frederica he preferred his androgynes to be more obscured more veiled more suggested and directed her attention to still-life fete gloanec # in which various inanimate objects two ripe pears a dense bunch of flowers swam across a bright red table-top rimmed with a black ellipse
the picture was signed madeleine bernard and alexander told frederica that gauguin had flirted seriously with that young woman had characterised her as was fashionable at the time as having the desirable unattainable androgynous perfection complete sensuality combined with unattainable self-sufficiency
frederica informed him from the catalogue that the vegetation was supposed to be a jocular portrait by gauguin of madeleine the pears her breasts the dense flowers her hair 
 you could read it another way said alexander interested now you could read the pears as androgynous in themselves as partly male 
 and the hair as other hair said frederica loudly scandalising a few bystanders amusing a few more
 you like to cork for your images don't you alexander
 it's age said alexander peaceably untruthfully
they were beginning to attract a penumbra of gallery-goers as though they were offering a guided tour
they moved on to the olive pickers
daniel's mind was elsewhere 
he remembered a straight mass of red-gold hair in cold king's chapel more golden than foxy frederica's slowly settling onto a collar as the pins released their grip 
he saw a mass of freckles sometimes melding into sixpenny-sized brown patches of warmth moving over the hard frame of cheekbones and brow
the sexless voices rose in the cold
 unto us a boy is born
 herod then with wrath was filled 
the voices played with the slaughter of the innocents treble and descant hunting each other while she bowed her head unable to sing in tune
the olives had been painted from the asylum at st r�my in #
as for me i tell you as a friend i feel impotent when confronted with such nature for my northern brains were oppressed by a nightmare in those peaceful spots as i felt one ought to do better things with the foliage
yet i did not want to leave things alone entirely without making an effort but it is restricted to the expression of two things the cypresses the olive trees let others who are better and more powerful than i reveal their symbolic language
look here there is another question that comes to mind
who are the human beings that actually live among the olive the orange the lemon orchards
frederica and alexander held a discussion of natural supernaturalism
daniel looked at the pink sky the twisted trunks the silvery leaves the rhythmic earth streaked with yellow ochre with pink with pale blue with red-brown
olives frederica agreed with alexander could not recall the mount of olives the garden of gethsemane in the day of van gogh the pastor's son the lay preacher
as the cypresses must always differently mean death 
daniel asked for politeness really why van gogh had been mad was it just that he was driven
alexander said that it may have been a form of epilepsy exacerbated by the atmospheric-electric disturbances of the mistral and the heat
or you could make a freudian explanation
he felt guilty towards the child who had not survived for whom he had been named
he had been born on march #th #
his dead brother vincent van gogh had been born on march #th #
he was in flight from his family his dead alter ego his uncertain sense of identity
he wrote to theo i hope you are not a van gogh
essentially i am not a van gogh
i have always looked upon you as theo daniel said he could not see the pain frederica said was in the olives and alexander still lecturing said that vincent had objected to paintings of symbolic christs in gethsemane by bernard and his comp�res had torn up his own had made do with the olives themselves
he told daniel about the terrible st r�my painting of the blasted tree about noir-rouge and daniel said that it was odd that these orchards should be all over the walls of other asylums now to cheer people up
the trees stood under their haloes of pink and green strokes small flying things solidified light movements or saccades of the eye brushstrokes pigment
here is a description of a canvas which is in front of me at the moment
a view of the park of the asylum where i am staying onthe right a grey terrace and a side wall of the house
some deflowered rose bushes on the left a stretch of the park red-ochre the soil scorched by the sun covered with fallen pine needles 
this edge of the park is planted with large pine-trees whose trunks and branches are red-ochre the foliage green gloomed over by an admixture of black
these high trees stand out against an evening sky with violet stripes on a yellow ground which higher up turns into pink into green
a wall also red-ochre shuts off the view and is topped only by a violet and yellow-ochre hill
now the nearest tree is an enormous trunk struck by lightning and sawed-off
but one side branch shoots up very high and lets fall an avalanche of dark green pine needles 
this sombre giant a defeated proud man contrasts when considered in the nature of a living creature with the pale smile of a last rose on the fading bush in front of him
to emile barnard st r�my december #
you will realise that this combination of red-ochre of green gloomed over by grey the black streaks surrounding the contours produces something of the sensation of anguish called noir-rouge from which certain of my companions in misfortune frequently suffer
i am telling you about this to remind you that one can try to give an impression of anguish without aiming straight at the historic garden of gethsemane
daniel thought about dead ann maguire who like anna van gogh the dutch pastor's wife had named a younger hopeful child for a dead one
though in van gogh's case the names theodorus vincent vincent theodorus appeared and reappeared from generation to generation the cultural parallels to certain persisting aspects of the family face a heavy brow an intense blue eye a cheek bone a nostril
in the churchyard in his last parish a family in the english # had tried to name a son walter cornelius brittain and had buried three aged five aged two aged one month interspersed by variegated dead daughters a jennet a marian an eva
in august # a car containing an ira gunman possibly already dead ploughed onto a pavement and killed three of mrs maguire's children joanne eight john two andrew six weeks leaving one son mark aged seven
people had been shocked by numbers as well as by gratuitous death itself as people will be and mrs maguire's sister and a friend had founded the peace people whose brave beginning and sad end will not be chronicled here 
ann maguire had borne a second joanne in new zealand from where she had returned unable to bear cultural transplantation 
although the papers referred to her as the peace mother she had not been active in the peace people
she had brought a case for legal compensation for her dead children's lives and for her own suffering and one of her few recorded public utterances was to call the first offer of compensation pitiful
the day of the hearing of her second case she had been found dead
daniel had pieced the story together from the radio with throat wounds
foul play was not suspected and from conflicting newspapers
 with hedge-cutters
 with a carving knife
 with an electric carving-knife by her side
her motives the coroner was to say were not completely easy to understand
daniel who had become a specialist in wild blows of chance thought he understood some of it
he had not prayed for ann maguire
he was not that kind of priest
he had metaphorically shaken a large fist impotently at some looming energy-field and got on with his work his work
he followed the other two into the dark shadows of the room housing the low countries
nuns ascended and descended a cool grey stair in winged white caps
the lauriergracht in amsterdam was gloomed and glittering
mondriaan's evening was sombre and cloudy
he liked these 
like vincent although he was unaware that vincent had remarked on it he had northern brains and responded biologically and spiritually to tones of black donkey-brown varied greys touches of white in dark 
 one of the most beautiful things done by the painters of this country has been the painting of black which nevertheless has light in it vincent had written from holland
xavier mellery the painter of the nuns was described in the catalogue as creating a light which is the negation of that which envelops our immediate visual experience of things it is rather the interior light of your mind
daniel was used to such language it was his daily or anyway weekly pabulum 
he knew about the light shining in darkness and had come for reasons completely different from alexander's desire for exactness specificity to mistrust figurative language
he never now made a sermon from a metaphor nor drew analogies he preached examples cases lessons
but he liked the black dutch paintings they were so to speak on his wavelength 
he cornered frederica
 you said you'd news of will
 a postcard yes
 where this time
 kenya
on the way to the ugandan famine i think
 hippie said daniel
 helping out said frederica
 what use comparatively is a chap like that wi' no training no medical no
another mouth to feed
it makes me wild 
 i think he is often useful in his way 
you judge him so he judges me
judging runs in the family
 it does said frederica
 once said daniel i was in charing cross hospital someone's kid had taken an overdose and died they pump them out there regular clockwork but this one's liver couldn't take any more
anyway there i was going up this endless corridor thinking what to do about the mother who blamed herself wi' reason mind you she was one of those soft suckering witch- but that made it worse not better and there was th' trolley wi' the dead girl on it sliding by me sheet right over porters in those soft theatre boots and floppy plastic bathcaps and when they'd got past me and were turning in't door the first one looked at me from under his plastic frills with my own face 
i was shocked for a minute
got all his hair tucked up in that thing you see otherwise he's not so like me not strikingly so
 hi he said
 going about your father's business are you
so i asked him what he was up to and he said he was going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it and then he pushed th trolley in and i went in after and the mother began her howling and shrieking and will said well i'll walk off and leave you to it
and i said where are you going then
and he said i told you
to and fro
that was the last i saw of will
the nuns ascended the stairs in a perpetual cool silence
 quoting scripture for his own purposes said daniel
 that was rather funny i thought said frederica
 anything on the postcard about coming back 
any plans 
 no
sometimes she wished will would not write to her at all if he would send no messages to daniel
sometimes she told herself the postcards or exercise book scrawls were messages to daniel but one should never she considered ignore surface meanings in favour of implications and the damned things were addressed to her to frederica
 oh hell she said
 not to worry said daniel
 i'll push off 
i'll see you
 you haven't seen the pictures
 i'm not in the mood
 we were going to have coffee in fortnum and mason's
 no thank you all the same
wednesday # january #
clare still swapped one night a week off with stephanie and reported subsequent events to gilda who now managed the shoe shop occasionally she visited clare for an evening meal
as clare poured sherry gilda asked so how was the boac pilot
tony was the worst yet
clare never felt embarrassed discussing sex with gilda who could talk about little else
he'd read all the sex manuals ever printed
whipped a porn magazine out of his flight case after the first gin and tonic
he was coldly determined to be a good lover
for me that was a total turn-off 
porn pictures are a turn-off to most women
women like words not pictures gilda said as she sipped her drink
but i'm starting to think that everything's a turn-off for you doll 
you clearly can't have sex with fellas you ain't fond of
i expect you need a chap you know well someone you feel comfortable with not these one-nighters
she swallowed half the glass
now me i'm the reverse 
if i don't give a damn about em i ain't anxious and if i ain't anxious then i come easy
she drained her glass
when tony couldn't get me to climax he wanted to ask another girl over clare said
he automatically assumed that i was a lesbian
 not what he meant gilda said
lots of guys find it a turn-on to watch two women making love 
how very odd 
can you imagine a woman trying to get two men into bed so could watch them
forget this guy said gilda
i know what need clare someone you know and trust someone who won't make you feel anxious
then you'll relax and it'll happen then you'll stop being one of them miserable nymphos who hop from man to man hoping for mr right the man who can satisfy her
as gilda held out her glass to be refilled she added reflectively although you seem more lonely than horny 
are you looking for sex or just someone to talk to 
you ain't likely to pick up prince charming in a bar
clare said i'm not looking for prince charming
i don't want the disorder the pain the mess or the misery of being in love
i just want a short-term relationship without responsibility
gilda laughed
so do these fellas you pick up 
but i'm not convinced that's right for you
need a secure situation with someone you can trust who you know will stick around because he loves you
i'll tell you who you ought to fall in love with clare
who
yourself
you clearly think that you're a piece of worthless rubbish and if i pick up those vibes then so do the blokes
why not give sex a rest for a bit and pay a bit of attention to yourself
you never want to make a man the centre of your existence
that place is for you clare
i am the centre of my existence clare sang chanting a psalm pitching her voice an octave lower as she pushed josh to her playgroup the next morning
a man stood on the porch his hands in the pocket of his beige mackintosh
good morning
are you a prospective parent
clare asked
she felt in her pocket for the key 
no said the man
i'm an inspector for the local education authority
after examining the bathroom the inspector pointed out that legally one toilet was required for every seven kiddies
clare said but if each child goes there every two and a half hours one lavatory is adequate
there is a potty for emergencies
we have never had a problem
the inspector was not listening
he was making notes on other violations
half an hour after the inspector left as if to prove his point the lavatory refused to flush
the following morning clare's playgroup was ordered to close 
two days later clare's mind was unexpectedly diverted from her personal problems no job no man when the cnd office telephoned to ask her for voluntary evening help they were organizing another protest after a nuclear accident
over spain an american b-# bomber carrying an h-bomb had collided in mid-air with another aircraft
the h-bomb with an explosive capacity of more than a million tons of tnt had fallen into the atlantic ocean off southern spain
clare felt cheered to be back among like-minded people doing something worth while
monday # february #
valentine's day brought two happy events
the radio reported that the missing h-bomb had been located on the atlantic seabed
and to clare's delight she sold the lease of the apartment in which she ran her playgroup for a profit of twenty-three per cent
clare felt as if she had won a sweepstake
on the following morning she bought a portable tv a warm winter coat for herself and new clothes for josh
she didn't buy any toys for josh because she had decided to open a toy shop
two weeks later clare bought the short lease of a small shop in the pimlico road close to mrs gooden's home
though there was a lot to do clare busy redecorating the shop and visiting wholesalers to buy stock still managed to work one evening a week for the movement
in mid-april just before her toy shop opened clare's weary amiable national health doctor lookedupfrom his desk and said about your vaginal symptoms mrs shapiro
you'd better go to st stephen's for tests they're properly equipped to handle this sort of thing 
he seemed uneasy
what sort of thing 
not cancer
no gonorrhoea the doctor said apologetically
clare almost fainted from surprise and anxiety horror and shame
then she wept
the doctor refused to give her more sleeping tablets but scribbled a prescription for tranquillizers which were increasingly prescribed for women like clare with symptoms of anxiety in stressful situations such as poverty divorce or bereavement women with marital problems and women who were out of work also found them helpful although the pills did nothing to resolve the problem responsible for the initial anxiety
clare who blushed with shame whenever she thought about it waited anxiously for the result of her tests at st stephen's hospital
the tests were negative
but within a month she couldn't get through the day without tranquillizers she felt less anxious calmer
clare managed to open the red rocking horse by mid-may
at the opening party an excited three-and-a-half josh rode the pretty antique red rocking horse in the shop window 
monday # august #
standing by the swimming pool at saracen miranda beckoned to adam who was floating on the water in a transparent blow-up plastic armchair
in a voice of soft persuasion she said will you do something for me adam
i'm going to learn to fly
i want you to break the news gently to gran
but you promised your grandmother to learn to fly adam objected
it was a condition of her gift to you the ten thousand pounds capital to start kits
i didn't say for ever
i'll pay the money back to her
miranda was defiant
i've always wanted to fly
i won't be held by a promise that was unfairly extracted from me before i legally became an adult
and i get bored with nothing to do on holiday but lie in the sun
when are you starting
adam asked resigned
this morning at the cannes flying school
they have english instructors
four hours of instruction a day for two weeks
and of course this time of year it's perfect flying weather
miranda was triumphant now
i've already passed the two written exams
did law and meteorology last easter and now i've finished navigation radiotelephony and technical that was the toughest 
so that's why you're so pale
three hours later two thousand feet above the mediterranean miranda alert and exultant sat next to her instructor at the controls of a trainer plane an ugly little single-engine rallye which her instructor described as efficient and forgiving you could do something wrong m a rallye without getting immediately punished for it
flying was even better than she had hoped better than skiing better than driving a sports car
as the rallye droned towards the lighthouse on the tip of cap camerat miranda felt she were breathing the air of the gods 
gently they swooped turned and climbed in the azure sky
after they reached two thousand feet the instructor showed her how to fly level he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick manoeuvring the plane m every direction
miranda felt that the aircraft was an extension of her arms and her fingertips outspread in flight
heading west on the return flight path the instructor said this is the first time i've flown with a pupil and haven't once needed to touch the controls
miranda pushed home this advantage
then can i land
the instructor hesitated then said why not
the girl was clearly a natural flyer
after being given clearance to land miranda following her instructor's directions started her approach she throttled back to reduce speed and control her descent as she flew towards the threshold the point just before she intended to touch down
the plane was now moving at not much above stalling speed
as the rallye dropped to about thirty feet above the runway miranda throttled back completely and held the stick back
the plane seemed to glide forward and land itself
the undemonstrative miranda flung her arms around the instructor
oh thank you
thank you
quite a smooth landing the instructor said approvingly he hesitated then warned next time be careful not to land too fast or you'll run out runway
this woman was adventurous and ambitious such pilots did not live long
he added pilots are the ones that survive
a good pilot never takes a risk
the opposite of a good businessman miranda said still on a high 
a businessman has to take risks constantly and win sixty per cent of the time
in the air that risk factor would kill you 
nine hundred years earlier the great hall had been the hub of castle life wolfhounds ate on floors strewn with rushes servants slept on straw pallets thrown on the floor
then the winter salon did not smell of lilies and expensive leather but of stale fat stinking human bodies and animal ordure
elinor sometimes thought of all the love and the hatred the treachery and the killing that this hall had undoubtedly seen when strong men fought hand-to-hand to the death to protect their women and children
now the winter salon at saracen where elinor waited for adam was not only the coolest but the most impressive room in the ch�teau
high arched walls of pale honey-coloured stone were hung with bluish-green tapestries around the big stone fireplace where logs burned in winter stood sofas covered in the blues and greens of the tapestries here and there were lamps flowers books and piles of parlour games
what's keeping adam
elinor asked buzz who was adding up the scrabble score 
you said three o'clock
it's only two-thirty buzz said
ninety-three for you two hundred and sixty-four for me
that's not a bad score for you nell
buzz never cheated to let elinor win she knew that elinor would immediately sense this and feel humiliated
after an intensive rehabilitation programme of physiotherapy and speech therapy elinor appeared to have completely recovered from her stroke although she could no longer think of three things at once which buzz said was a mercy for the people who had to live with her
elinor was sometimes at a loss for the right word or name and then became impatient with herself she was often frustrated because she couldn't move as swiftly as she did before 
at times she was downhearted and wondered whether she would ever write another book
when you want to write you'll write buzz would tell her then 
now buzz grunted look what i tore out of the 
she dug into her pocket unfolded a bit of newspaper and read sportsman jim clark today opened a splendidly equipped physical training college at larkwood in wiltshire formerly the family home of the o'dare family
lady o'dare commented i wish them well
i doubt that 
elinor peered at the photograph of the new owner a motor-racing hero standing with her sister-in-law marjorie
the doorbell sounded
i'll go buzz said
it's either adam or the postman
buzz returned reading a postcard
it's for you from sonia rushleigh
whoops i mean bromley
who'd have thought them two would marry
she says the colonel's taken up petit point and miss hawkins is teaching him
remember her the schoolmistress
i do indeed said elinor
frumpy sourpuss
who's the letter from
clare
buzz held the envelope out to elinor
elinor shook her head
you open it
it's marked personal
i don't want to read it unless she apologizes
buzz opened the letter and read it
she shook her head
it's just a friendly letter asking how you are
but reading between the lines i think clare needs money
if she took her poor child back to his father and gave her husband a second chance she wouldn't need money
how about a bit of generosity
buzz said
you're a silly stubborn old woman
and clare's just as stubborn and just as silly
it wouldn't have hurt her to say she was sorry
elinor looked anxious
do you really think she's short of money buzz
i wouldn't want her to have a rough time
this remark was overheard by adam as in pale blue shirt and jeans he sauntered through the door
he said elinor you allowed ample provision in the trust for helping clare if the trustees consider that help is needed
i'll check on clare when i get back to london
he put a pile of papers on a side table
there's rather a lot of paperwork here things that you should be aware of
we've had more paperwork not less since the trust took over buzz said tartly 
and i tell you frankly that i can't follow it adam
i thought the trustees were going to manage the business
elinor shouldn't be made to wade though pages of paragraphs with no commas in em
of course the trustees manage the business and they do it very well adam said
and there's no reason for elinor to see any of this if it tires her
in fact i'm about to suggest something that would simplify matters
what's that 
buzz asked
i'd like to substitute paul littlejohn for myself in the power of attorney that i hold on your behalf elinor
i'm trying to reduce the number of business administrators the fewer there are the simpler the system and the cheaper it will be
does that mean that paul will be legally responsible for elinor's affairs instead of you adam
yes but that's only a technicality
paul will do as i say
and i'd also like you to sign this document adam added which absolves me and stg from any further responsibility once paul littlejohn has been substituted
buzz said but surely
smoothly adam explained the responsibility must clearly rest m only one area 
it's in your interests to clarify the situation 
it's customary
if you think that's best adam dear
elinor frowned slightly at buzz
adam decided to hold back miranda's bombshell until later after elinor drank her evening glass of champagne 
just before five o'clock when the business session had ended and the afternoon was still hot quiet and heavy with languor buzz left to get some tea
adam escorted elinor to the elevator after taking her to her bedroom he intended to go to the beach for a swim
in the high-ceilinged kitchen surrounded by the smells of mint and basil buzz whistled roses of picardy with much dramatic warbling as she prepared elinor's tea
leaves and yellow blossoms obscured the top of the window while the bottom was covered by aggressive pink hollyhocks seemingly determined to fight their way inside
sylvie the cook sat at the big kitchen table by the window writing a list and shooing pigeons away
the bane of sylvie's life was the pigeon droppings that littered the windowsill and had to be cleaned up daily
with a shudder sylvie refused a cup of tea
still whistling buzz laid the tray
the soporific calm of the drowsy afternoon was shattered by the bell indicator above the kitchen door
someone was jabbing the bell non-stop in elinor's bedroom
knowing that adam was probably in the elevator on his way to the beach buzz hurled herself out of the kitchen and ran upstairs
frantically she tore open the door to elinor's apartment
in the passage she stumbled and almost fell then flung back the door to the bedroom
to her relief elinor was not slumped on the floor deathly white she clung for support to the silver brocade hangings of her bed
wordlessly she pointed above the fireplace
buzz turned her head to the left where the portrait of the three sisters hung
at first buzz saw nothing but then she gasped in horror 
each of the three long creamy necks had been cut horizontally a small triangle of canvas hung downward from each slashed throat

wednesday # august #
in the foyer of the clanrickard club mike grant leaned against the wall at the bottom of a double-sided curving staircase
with his hands in the pockets of his dinner jacket he surveyed the room
it was going to be a good night in spite of the fact that it was august and a wednesday
making sure to appear casual he carefully watched the men in dinner jackets and the women in full-length dresses move slowly over the red carpet towards the restaurant at the rear or climb the staircase to the gaming rooms
mike noticed a group of heavy gamblers most of them greek move towards the baccarat room where the sultan of rupolei had been losing for the last hour
his attention was also caught by a woman dressed in midnight-blue satin and diamonds the sister of a middle-eastern ruler she was known as an audacious gambler
he stiffened as he recognized a man move upstairs with a distinctive boneless saunter he had better send someone up to check the backgammon room
the club owners the casinos and the multinational bookmakers knew which professional gamblers successfully played games that contained an element of skill such as backgammon and pokerand they preferred to have nothing to do with them ideally the house welcomed inexperienced rich idiots
this is certainly a good night to play the odds
mike heard a sarcastic voice from behind him
he turned and smiled at adam
come into my office for a drink
what's up 
in mike's office furnished with heavily varnished victorian club furniture
adam shook his head curtly at the offer of a chair
i'm not staying he said
i merely wanted to tell you that you've scared the hell out of everyone at saracen except me
so kindly curb your theatrical james bond streak 
i knew immediately what your message meant if you don't pay up one slash is all it takes 
he glared at his brother
i thought you were fond of elinor
i seem to recall that elinor helped you to buy your first good bike
why drag her into my problems
you might have given her another stroke 
i don't know what the hell you're talking about and i can't comment until i do
mike his face alert and wary lit a cigarette
adam briefly described how the triple portrait had been slashed and added d'you really expect me to believe that you had nothing to do with it
told some cat burglar where to find that picture
mike stared at his brother then slowly said not me
i agree it's clearly a warning to pay but i swear i know nothing about it
it couldn't have been the brothers they'd be even less subtle
he inhaled deeply
who else do you owe money adam you stupid bastard 
no one who'd do anything so bloody childish
how do i stop this bloody nonsense
how many times must i tell you that if you let things go too far nobody can stop what will undoubtedly happen
adam mike went on quietly you've always taken full advantage of anyone who's fond of you
you think you can push me around because you've been doing that since we were in the nursery
you also grew up watching grandfather's clients literally get away with murder
he sucked on his cigarette furiously threw it into the fireplace shoved his hands in his pockets and glared at adam
do you to be found washed up on the seashore with a few vital bits missing
are you so anxious to know what it feels like to have both eyeballs gouged out one at a time
do you want to be slowly battered to death before dying in agony
of course not you bastard adam said
i only want to know who slashed that picture if you didn't
whoever they are and only you know that these people are serious
punters often try to avoid paying
examples often have to be made 
you know that 
mike started to stride up and down the room
take that fucking urbane look off your face and face reality adam
if you lose money that's tough 
but if you don't pay up that's insanity
i've had enough of your melodrama adam snarled 
mike glared at his brother again
i'm not exaggerating
remember that incident when the sultan's sister had her rolls stopped at two in the morning on the grande corniche after leaving the casino
they blew away the chauffeur's head with a machine gun
wasn't touched
she paid all her gambling debts the very next day
and when the story was carefully leaked to the newspapers quite a lot of other debts were suddenly settled in full
i'm not some goddamned sultan's sister
no but you also like playing with fire 
you never believe that the gods will really let it burn 
you think you're omnipotent but you aren't
keep your voice down adam growled 
i'll do what i bloody well like in my own office mike said
don't you understand
i'm on your side adam
you're the only brother i have 
his voice deepened 
i'm probably more worried about this than you are
if anything happened to you
i'd be left without you
so for god's sake pay up you stupid shit 
don't think you can get away with it just because you've always got away with everything since you set that nursemaid's apron alight 
i thought you were too young to remember that adam said uneasily
he added she shouldn't have left the matches within reach of a child
she was in hospital for six weeks and i was the only one who knew it wasn't an accident
i knew you wanted to see 
let's not argue about something that happened over thirty years ago adam said finally
can you raise money to help me fend them off
i promise you
within six months i i'll have no more money problems
never again
you'll have money problems as long as you gamble adam
annabel was determined to get a grip on herself and do as scott advised remember # as the year she stopped having to go to auditions and # as the year in which she blossomed into a successful young new york hostess as she met andy warhol lenny bernstein baby jane holzer and all the other gossip-columnist fodder 
by july annabel was a junior friend of the metropolitan museum a friend of the museum of modern art and a patron of the bronx zoo
she also allayed her insecurity with a massive spending spree each charity dinner required a new ballgown and each new glittering friend contacts for scott required a glittering party
so the year thus far was a busy one
the long road home 
cia hq langley
sorge had never been to langley before
it was not something a russian expected to do
it was after # am when nowak drove him through the gates past the guards and into the vast underground car-park
why langley
sorge had asked him on the way out of washington
they want to show you that they trust you
i don't expect i'll see much
nowak laughed
damn right
we park in the underground car-park catch a special lift to the fifth floor and walk across the corridor into a special conference room
that's trust
that's trust
the executive director was already in the meeting room
welcome to langley
he held his hand out in welcome
when the introductions were complete the exec director the dda the ddi sorge and nowak settled themselves round the small conference table
we have a new problem kicked off the exec director
the english operative who was guarding trimmler has taken off
he's also taken an agent of ours with him
as hostage
a woman
we believe they're still in new orleans
why asked sorge concerned
i don't know yet
what about goodenache
he decided to turn the pressure on the russian
he caught a flight to frankfurt
he hired a car but the car was found abandoned on the outskirts of frankfurt
we are trying to find our missing scientist now
are the german authorities involved 
no
we have our own means 
sorge saw the exec director look up his eyebrows raised suddenly
we both have our methods
even in an independent germany
after all it was the death of our people in these situations that has brought us together
the exec director shrugged
bastard russians were still up to their old tricks 
he ignored the pointed look the ddi was giving him
i thought it best if the director of our operationsin new orleans gave you a run down of what has taken place up to now
he sat back and let the dda give a full report includingthe trip to the voodoo ceremony and all that followed 
sorge didn't stir even when they mentioned the gruesome spectacle of trimmler's arms folded in the sign of a swastika
we still aren't convinced that trimmler's death has anything to do with the death of our agents
there's no definite link 
the situation might be clearer when i've finished
sorge looked round the table saw their undisguised curiosity
in # in germany we had a gru network named the 
what's that asked the exec director
red orchestra 
the nazis called it that because we had radio operators we code-named musicians
their leader the chef we called him was leopold trepper
it was this group that radioed the warning of operation blue the attack on stalingrad that led to hitler's biggest wartime disaster on the russian front 
who was feeding you all this information in germany asked the exec director
high-ranking officials
both in the military and in the government
they saw the damage hitler was doing
they didn't disagree with his aims only his methods
when they saw that the war could not be won even as early as # some of them opened up lines of communication with us and the british
we didn't get that sort of stuff till late into # said the dda
you weren't europeans
we had centuries of contacts to fall back on
for all their bravery and resourcefulness their information was often wasted because stalin didn't believe them
but then he found it difficult to believe anyone
the germans with more sophisticated radio-tracking equipment started to track down the musicians 
even trepper was captured and the was wound up at the end of #
our information continued for a while but it was of doubtful origin
trepper was interrogated bythe gestapo and we believed he became a double agent a lot of misinformation was received in moscow
sorge leant across and finished his coffee before continuing
but we still needed information
the overall network with sources inside germany was the 
the red what said the exec director pleased that he had deciphered the first word of the new code-name
three
the redthree
based in switzerland and named after the three transmitters that they used
the most important source of information from agents inside germany was from a group under rudolf roessler
his code-name was lucy and his network the lucy ring 
roessler or lucy was a swiss intelligence officer of german extraction
he had many contacts in germany
lucy's four main contacts were major general oster who was the head of the abwehr admiral canaris who was later hanged for his part in the # bomb plot carl goehdeler who was leader of the official opposition to hitler and colonel boetzel the commanding officer of intelligence evaluation
there were others but lucy never disclosed any of them to us
even after the war asked the ddi
the lucy ring was disbanded in # after being responsible for some invaluable work
i won't go through all their successes but it was substantial 
the british were involved with them through us and it was their advanced work on breaking cyphers that enabled the ring to establish such a great record
but the ring disbanded once more because of stalin's penchant for secrecy after moscow tried to bypass roessler and go direct to his number two 
so where's the link interrupted the dda impatient as ever
it's important you understand the background said sorge not allowing the american to get under his skin 
nothing further came from the ring until the last few weeks of the war
with the allies advancing on the eastern and western fronts many high-ranking germans were out to save their own necks
the lucy ring was reactivated this time without the knowledge of the british
or the americans commented the exec director
i suggest you take that up with comrade stalin replied sorge drily
it was an impressive list 
they didn't just have knowledge
they also had wealth
in all forms 
art cash in every form possible
they used the ringbecause of their line into switzerland
they wanted the security of the swiss banksand the russian bear 
one was dependent on the other
so they bought immunity 
while our boys were still getting killed snapped the ddi
as were ours snapped back sorge
but your hands weren't that clean 
you were bringing scientists and others into america just as we were
scientists with nazi records scientists with a history of brutality war criminals
gentlemen please said nowak ever the diplomat
can we just stick to what we're here to discuss
go on dimitri
sorge was annoyed with himself irritated that he had allowed the intelligence man to get under his skin 
of course he smiled back 
now ah yes we used the lucy ring
many germans withtheir prizes crossed safely into switzerland
they came in cars army lorries even an aeroplane
their riches were stored in the banks under private accounts and then they were brought through czechoslovakia and east germany into the soviet union
all of them asked the dda
those who broke their word were hunted down
and disposed of 
some needed reminding that we expected them to honour their word
it was a cold reminder of their world of the business they traded in daily
we had a large colony of nazis living in the soviet union
they weren't all scientists in fact we had littleuse for most of them
they had their own estates and farms to the west of moscow
they kept their secret identities and paid for it through their swiss bank accounts
but they remained germans always dreaming of going back to the fatherland one day
how many nazis did you take to russia after the war
the narodnyi kommissariat vnutrennikh del our people's commissariat for internal affairs was responsible for 
i never heard of them the dda stopped him
nkvd explained the ddi patronizingly
wiped out twenty million russians for stalin
that right he challenged sorge
more
thirty million
according to official sources sorge riposted
a most useful organization
that should shut them up 
he felt the look of disbelief pass between the exec director and the dda
the other just watched him the mocking smile still on his lips
he would be the one rostov had warned him to be wary of
he decided to wipe the smile off his face
thirty thousand
that's how many east germans we deported into the soviet union after the war
the ddi's smile disappeared 
thirty thousand nazis
jesus
yes
and we kept another hundred and twenty thousand between # and # in hitler's old concentration camps
many were nazis but businessmen and professionals were also our targets 
a third of those died
the others were eventually releasedand absorbed into the democratic republic
including nazi sympathizers
probably
doesn't that concern you
sorge shrugged
not really
i was eight years old at the time
it wasn't the answer that the ddi expected and sorge regretted his words
he wasn't here to make jokes
the thirty thousand in the soviet union as i said became a community in their own right
without our knowledge over the years with the use of their money and supportive people in the swiss banks they forged contacts with those left behind in east germany
they all had one dream 
to see a unified germany
to regain what they had lost 
they had a code-name amongst themselves
something that linked them was a reminder of how they had got there 
it had to be a safe name innocuous nothing that would draw attention to the past
they remembered the lucy network their gateway out of germany
they called themselves die lucie geister
the lucy ghosts 
yes
did the organization extend to america
the exec director was alarmed
how the hell did they
goodenache
i guess he was one of them asked the ddi
we weren't sure but in view of his sudden departure i would say yes
which ties trimmler in 
and god knows who else
the name grob mitzer mean anything
he was one of their leaders
it was the lucy ghosts who supplied him with the cash that helped him build his empire 
why didn't you stop it
damn it you knew about it for long enough snapped the exec director
we didn't realize how important it was
we thought they were like any other wartime group nothing more than reminiscences and marching songs
old men remembering their youth
the importance of it didn't surface until germany was reunified
and it was only the englishman overhearing the conversation between goodenache and trimmler that finally bridged the gap 
so why should the english guy take offwith the girl
the ddi changed the subject 
he's not one of us
i suggest you ask your allies about that 
maybe he's just an adventurer
no more
you must have cleared him
of course
the exec director didn't want his dirty washing wrung out in front of this russian
was there anything else
only that the gdr east germany as it was is different to the west
there are still many there who haven't forgotten the war
their attitude is different to us
some are still waiting for the war to end
they're a traditional people
many ex-nazis even gestapo working and living normal everyday lives
working for the stasi
the ddi reminded them all of the secret police who had run east germany with an iron fist 
some yes
others returned to the jobs they had before the war
within the new germany many of them have become frightened
their secrets are no longer safe 
most of all they fear the israelis
is frick one of these guys asked the dda remembering the name picked up by adam in new orleans
no lied sorge
his orders were quite specific
don't ratify any names
they didn't want the yanks stumbling in and screwing up in an attempt to force the issue
so what's all this got to do with the deaths of our agents continued the dda
we're not sure
except that a lot of the information we have both lost was about the lucy ghosts
link that with trimmler's death goodenache's sudden departure for germany and the mention of the lucy ghosts during their conversation and i think you will agree that is the strongest lead we have to follow 
nobody spoke for a while then the exec director reopened the discussion
has moscow any suggestions as to how we should proceed 
no replied sorge which was what he'd been told to say
we hoped you would come up with something
i'm sure we will 
can you tell us the names of some of these lucy ghosts cut in the ddi
the ones in russia
how high up the ladder did they go 
sorge enjoyed his reply
in time yes
but i can tell you you're wasting your efforts lookingfor martin bormann in south america
he died twenty years ago
he watched their stunned faces across the room
well and truly shafted
they said little after that and sorge was soon being escorted with nowak down to the underground garage
five minutes later they were on their way back to washington
bormann
fucking bormann
they had him all the time said an astonished ddi
would'ya believe it
they probably got hitler stashed away too
well it's been a real eye-opener said the exec director
but let's not forget we've still got a crisis on 
find the englishman
that's our first priority
find him and see what the son of a bitch is up to 
the amtrak crescent atlanta georgia
the train pulled out of atlanta station at # pm four minutes behind schedule
they had slept well eaten well slept again and eventually gotbored with the passing countryside
adam had insisted they stay in the room and she hadn't found a good enough reason to change his mind
he was thumbing through usa today for the umpteenth time looking for something he might have missed when he heard her giggling
she was in the swivel chair reflected in the window with the dark night as a backdrop her head angled towards him 
what's so funny he asked pleasantly putting the paper down
you sure know how to give a girl a good time
don't i he grinned back 
according to all the books a secret agent's life's meant to be glamorous 
we've spent twenty-four hours together and in that time i've been bitten by bugs in a hooker's bed tied up a guy with no legs and stolen his wheelchair stayed cooped up in a train for twelve hours with an attractive man and behaved like a virgin
don't take that the wrong way 
but james bond would've handled it differently
he was scottish
i'm english
they prefer the ram 'em and bang 'em method
we're more sophisticated in our approach 
what happens next 
in which department 
in the where're-we-going department 
to nordhausen
that's where trimmler said he would meet goodenache
trimmler's dead
and goodenache's running from the russians
he can't go back there
from what i heard germany was still their home 
and nordhausen was where they shared something special
they wanted to go there
if goodenache's frightened and he wants to hide that's as good a place as any
nordhausen
where is that 
central germany
south of berlin near what was the old east-west border 
an industrial town
it was also where the nazis built most of their rockets the v# and v# during the second world war
from what i remember they moved most of the rocket manufacture down there so that our bombers couldn't get to them
built the factory right in the heart of the mountains
used slave labour
i think a lot of people died in the making of those weapons before they ever got launched and blew up half of london
why would they want to go back there
who knows
maybe it was a job they never finished 
but they did
those guys put people into space put our people on the moon
that's enough for most people
that was just their work
and they didn't do it for germany
they did it for their conquerors
you telling me that all those scientists spent their time in america and couldn't wait to gethome 
not all of them
most of them became good americans
and good russians i suppose
but these two wanted to go home 
they never stopped being germans
maybe it's the only thing they ever dreamt about 
weird
is it
to want to go home 
all they're after is their youth
catching up with what they thought they'd lost 
aren't we all
she shrugged and looked thoughtful
penny for them he said
i was uh just being a woman
tell me
thinking of peter
ah
the venerable ex
i know
here's us heading for trouble and god knows what else and in the middle of you talking about nordhausen i start thinking of peter
wondering what the hell he's up to 
the emotional mind of a woman
stop knocking yourself
makes a change 
i usually leave that to you
he burst out laughing
ok tough guy
what's got you so tickled
here we are crammed in a small compartment in a train hurtling across america being chased bythe cia the fbi and god knows who else and you're worried about your ex-husband's sex life
christ he must've been good
he was a shit 
so why
adam stopped and shook his head
because some of us like shits 
don't ask me why
she laughed with him
he's cheap too
he once bought me a louis vuitton handbag
your travel case reminded me of it when we left the hotel
it was for our second anniversary
i broke the lock and took it back to the shop in la jolla
they told me it was a fake
a fucking hong kong fake
can you believe that 
what did he say
that he'd bought it in new york when he was there on a visit
and if he could remember where the shop was he'd go back and sue the bastards 
that's peter for you
a cheapskate liar and womanizer
and i can't let him go 
that's really pathetic news
isn't it
no
just human
very understanding
what would you know
maybe not women but my parents
and my twin brother
you're a twin
was
they all died when i was nine
you said they were out of the country
that you had guardians
we all have things to hide 
was he an identical twin
yes
that means you came from the same egg
that right
something like that 
he in his usual stoical manner didn't tell her that he had studiously learnt everything about twins and their relationships
i had a boyfriend in high school
he was a twin and his brother played on the football team 
if he got hurt my guy used to suffer too
we used to watch the game together and i'd suddenly see him wince in pain
just like that 
and i'd look on the field and it was his brother who'd been tackled
yes
something like that 
he laughed
i remember once getting a tap roundthe head from my dad
i'd done something wrong
i remember him saying it was a shame that he had to punish us both when only one of us was being naughty
that tap sorted us both out 
do you still feel he's with you 
he is
then you're lucky
you're not alone
is that so bad
i don't know why i'm alive and he's dead
what's his name
marcus
nice name
i'm glad you've got someone to love
it's important
ours is actually a new house
it was but er the market was so low that he decided not to well i don't think he could get a buyer actually it's just stood there so he he he let it out rather than have it stood there with the option for us to buy it but i say now the prices are lower he's not keen on selling it at that price
and i'm not prepared to go on paying three thousand a year renting it to give to him when i could be buying one myself
yeah
mm
i mean three thousand a year to rent one's a lot of money really
mm
hallo there 
oh hallo yeah sorry about that 
a bath and i was soaking in there for ages
i wasn't quite decent and i thought well i'm not letting people in when i'm not decent 
oh no 
i mean please excuse the mess won't you
doesn't matter
if you'd have let me in i could have washed your back for you
no no no
no i can manage on my own thank you
fair enough
fair enough
right
sorry to intrude on your on your privacy 
that's okay
but er there we are

all the units are obviously

everything that is here is mine with the exception of the carpets
yes
right
shall we go is that the bedroom through there
no that's the bathroom

no
it's er very cold in there
well it's good good got a well lagged tank 
yeah
which is not a bad
yeah that is it
that's what he said he had to 
that's not a bad thing in a way is it
no
it's better than having the water 
they actually took they actually took the front off so that the water would get hotter
erm and it didn't work and you know
mm
i thought then i'd be able to use it as an airing cupboard but it still didn't work but it's like you said it's because it's got such a good
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
and it does once you've actually heated the water it keeps hot for so long it's amazing 
ours is like that isn't it

yeah yeah
erm but here in the kitchen it's lovely and warm
but but it's quite it's a warm it's a warm 
yeah
i mean that heater is not on full not on full power
that's quite good isn't it
like ours
that's very much like the one i mean ours is on about two or something like that and 
yeah
we have ours on two and it's ever so warm
you go in there in the evenings you know when it's been when it's been off and 
yeah
as i say i mean well because i do feel the cold i suppose i have to have more heat than
yeah yeah
a normal person but er
yeah
quite nice really isn't it
yeah i like this too
the bathroom's a bit chilly but once you've put that heater on and shut the door for a few minutes it's
yeah
yeah
it's lovely
yeah we've got one like that i know
that's not my artwork on there that's my little niece's artwork
space under there as well

cold and he's always boiling 
if i have the heat up very high in the bedroom he can't sleep 
i'm impressed aren't you

very
it is lovely yeah
have the is there another flat then above this one then 
above 
yeah that's a bit smaller 
yeah the door there isn't it
that's a bit smaller
mm
do you hear them at all
erm sometimes if he's been out very very late and i'm still up and he's come home after a heavy night drinking
i mean i'm not saying he's alcoholic but he goes out with the lads and he you know he'll he'll sort of thud up the stairs
mm
but then he'll apologize the next day
man after me own heart
you know i mean other than that no i mean it it's not as if 
yeah i was gonna say same
this one 
oh probably probably
if he goes to the pub stuart would probably know him anyway 
might do yeah
more than likely
no i mean it it's not as if you hear the telly or 
oh i see these are his stairs 
that's the stairway 
that's his stairs yeah 
yeah
yes
his door's just there isn't it
yeah 
that's right yeah that's 
yes that's his door there and
yeah
that's his stairs out
but the upstairs one that's the kitchen's a bit smaller
erm and instead of the bath in the bathroom he's just got a shower up there 
probably is wardrobes there 
i must admit i like a shower but then again i do like the chance to have a bath now and again 
bath every every now and again yeah
yeah that's bigger
erm which is why i went for the downstairs cos i had a choice of either
but i went for the downstairs one because of the bath
yeah yeah
yeah be nice
it's nice
it's a nice size
i mean we've just been to look at some others and upstairs and downstairs 
but the upstairs one in the other one was was
was bigger than the downstairs
hell of a lot of difference really it's surprising just a
yeah
i mean i must admit i've looked at some other flats
erm and one i looked at i couldn't believe it
erm i mean it was a top floor flat
and so i mean you had to sort of go up several flights of stairs and you walked in and it it looked lovely
thought oh this is nice it erm it it had n't got a separate kitchen it was sort of a kitchen diner 
yeah 
mm 
but it was very big 
a studio 
mm
it was very big
i thought oh well this is lovely
walks into the bedroom well you would have hardly got the bed in there never mind about anything else
and er there was a hand basin in there and when you went into
in in the bedroom
in the bedroom
yeah
when you walked into the well what i would a cupboard but they classed it as the bathroom
you'd got the toilet there and behind the door i mean you had to sort of squeeze yourself and shut the door and behind the door was a shower
you're joking 
no shower curtain mind you
even so no room to swing a cat 
terrible
it was terrible
yes
this is nice though
i like this 
yeah i like this one 
very much
yeah it's a nice just a nice size

oh yeah
yeah this one i mean upstairs hasn't but this one has
and is there anything there i mean can you dry your clothes out there at all 
no
there's no line
can't get over the size of this though
i think i'd probably put my wardrobes on his on the stair wall
that would dampen it a bit wouldn't it 
mm
nice 
i like it
it's lovely and warm
very nice
yeah
what is your situation 
i mean are you renting the flat

thank you very much indeed for showing us your home 
thank you very much
i'm sorry to bother you 
if you can hear next door's music i can assure you it's not a regular occurrence
and if you tell him about it he he's in a rock band 
erm now and again he practises but he usually tries to do it when i'm not here but erm not 
seem quite friendly then 
yeah
well we we work shifts so he could probably do it when we're on earlies and
well that's right yeah 
and when we're on lates he can do it at

if you let him know 
we're not really in that much anyway are we

and that can work to your favour because if ever you have a problem then you know
yeah you can talk and
that's right

we fell out for a little while but i mean playing loud but i mean upstairs is fine
and next door to him number five they're an elderly couple erm and they've got one of their sons living there at erm he's disabled in some way but i'm not quite sure how
mm
but they are very very friendly
very friendly they are
mm
i suppose some people might say to them oh you're being nosy but then that doesn't bother me because you don't tell them what you don't want them to know
no 
that's right 
but it's nice because if ever you're poorly then it's in your welfare isn't it
that's right yeah

oh it's by the the van teresa

and john a bloody at tescos
if you ask me
why are they doing it if it's not to do
i dunno what can you do ann

should of i got a somewhere
well you'll have nine bulbs and lights out got a thousand to do ann's had
what
ann's had merv john teresa paul and vi's all trussing done the rest the of my trussing i've done the char grill i've done welcome break now they're on the tesco
i've only got a thousand sainsburys to do and we'll be all done by 
nine o'clock
or not long after so why have they been doing that if there's nothing much to do
why is john and ann and paul and teresa and all them been on that trussing line and merv
probably trying to get ahead for that one of those 
oh yeah but i wonder if we're gonna all finished by nine o'clock and you'll have us all in your ha ha ha
don't forget ann in fact it's probably one of and in the back 
well we would but we'll live
i've had a go but obviously not
not much else to do 
not much about no
well with all the trussing the might carry on trussing and get that done
or else we go in the afternoon and truss your pvc 
i don't know mate i only know that that's take us ann and paul and ann and john and all them all doing all the others so
we really ought to be going to some to truss

isn't he
sort of jewellery you see 
do they
for tesco and 
yeah 
quite casual erm sainsburys
ooh
they've all finished early they've unless they came in late with the order or something extras or something
i know five hundred and sixty was extra cos stuart gave me two hundred short of a thousand
mm cos somebody hadn't up wrong then where is she
probably ain't calculated enough have they
no that's what i say if calculated wrong 
we're always out they always tend 
mm 
to go over don't they 
yeah little bit over 
and they probably do the very small bags without 
yeah and that's 
bags that weren't that have come over there and need a recount kerry
hiya
how's it going 
not too bad
are you on tea
yep just going 
ten ten fifty eight
i've i've been in work some of these
his next victims
ask yourself 
they've gone on holiday
which one
yeah and we're supposed to do all of them 
you see put john one of us start trussing early but we didn't need one ann's got another team in the other room doing it
there still in there
i'll i'll be finished before long
yeah
well about another hour
have we got some more birds eye pies up to truss
yeah
they didn't do them
actually they perhaps let us go back on them then
well
tomorrow
if you do that i think perhaps that's the best kind of action have a word with him and go down i mean 
you mean go back on them cos we didn't finish them cos there was three pallets and we didn't even do two
there's only twelve with a last week weren't there
we didn't finish them cos they wanted to start trussing early 
it's what you had last week 
and then ann started that little line trussing you see so we've done it between us but i've got a thousand to do and she's got about four 
ann even if they do some 
i bet you feel like a now give them in when they can't truss them dunno 
that i've only had
we give them in when they came trussed with though we had before 
it's not very heavy really to start a truss that's 
well with the two lines going yeah would have been about right then but see john i don't suppose he realised ann was gonna fetch all the people out of here there and everywhere and start that up 
what did he do did he say 
well i 
ann
no
no so she started trussing helping me 
yeah yeah but he wouldn't 
i suppose that's what john thought we might not get them done start early and get them finished
that's good 
he just said leave the bird's eye pies and start your trussing
that was gone seven o'clock when 
yeah
by time we've cleared all that especially the 
all that pvc ann
are fourteen
and t d c when we come in i mean they hadn't checked any goujons they hadn't checked any of the fillets
bag here 
perhaps they'll get them
there was two baskets of bones
fillet drums 
jeanie and hilary are doing that 
go back and get some more breadcrumbs 
yeah yeah and i mean yeah we'll definitely be finished in about an hour
one 
won't be till ten anyway
and getting all the bird's eye
didn't we have a we're getting 
if we get in trainee 
in the daytime i'm going home i'm not putting upwithlike that 
they didn't want me

yeah that's it
oh i went we were absolutely you know everybody claimed something
you know what he's like
well he told me when i claimed 
that sort of person 
 you took three of them didn't you
who's that behind
he had peter he had that peter who's 
peter david didn't they and
david
over cook's side he only lasted about three more weeks i mean 
three weeks 
glenys has been doing it ever since 
that
ian only last about three or four weeks he was gone
that one he went didn't he
yep
and that peter
yeah
he couldn't even do your 
he wouldn't he didn't wanna do it did he 
he took it back 
he said he wanted office
ha
you know i remember him 
yes 
coming in cos john 
yeah 
said well you do what you did with him and show showing him how to do 
all the jobs he said i don't want to learn them i've come to supervise he said i don't wanna get mucky
oh no
i couldn't believe my ears
i said oh
so why john said would i show you how to truss nice i don't wish to learn thank you
is that what he said to you
yeah he said i 
oh i didn't know that 
he said he'd come to supervise not to do it
i've no no wish to learn it thank you
i said well fair enough i'll go to do something else
see john when he as soon as john arrived he said to me will you take me he said i don't wanna learn it proficiently but i want to know every job so i then took 
and then watch 
up and down every line 
every line 
you got to expect to be
and and when this peter come he said well you know just show him everything and like you did me and he said he didn't wanna know thank you
i didn't know he said that to him 
yeah he said 
yeah 
he said i come to be supervisor he said i don't know i don't wish to learn all that 
well can you supervise if you don't know what the hell's going on 
i said to john 
that's what john said he wanted 
i said last week
so he good a rough idea 
john i hope you don't mind i said got ta call he said you 
mm 
he said you should have asked jim 
yeah 
because it was between you and him 
well that's certainly my feeling i'm naturally disappointed but it i say you did well and er
mick said to me last night he said to me you can never fit not used to it but 
no point is there 
no there's certainly 
that's it 
i said i've failed
i said i just haven't got 
that's it
you're not forgiven 
no i'm listening to them i'm doing a project
aha
i'm taping all your conversations anyway 
oh right 
not in the factory i didn't i could of asked tom 
what in here 
everywhere i go
oh i shall be quiet 
it's all anonymous you're not nobody know who it is it's for it's for a dictionary and they want new words that are commonly used and they don't want and all old words that never get used it'll be dropped in the next edition of the dictionary 
i i anything
no it's er i'm taping all my conversations i have with everybody for a week
what if people don't want you to
oh yeah you you have to erase it but nobody's gonna i mean to say nobody knows who you are what you've said anyway at all do they
well i don't know if you're just gonna write down 
what 
what you put on there and that
i don't write anything i send the tape in they don't know who you are you're just a it's just a voice speaking nobody knows who you are or anything they only know me nobody else
then 
why
who's who's gonna know when they to compile a dictionary and what words you use who's gonna know who you are
ha dunno speaking 
that's all well if you want it erased i will i mean it's up to you entirely
well you won't have any trouble with jeanie
but 
ay i i've i've said that to them i said well you might have if i take to work you'll certainly hear some they said well if that's common usage words that's what it has to be and words that we never use at all that are in dictionaries and nobody ever uses them they want to know common ordinary speech words that we use 
can't get more common than me
ey i told them i said you might hear some right i was in the pub saturday night mind i did tell afterwards and he's ever such a nice fella he comes over door
so he's killing himself laughing i i've got to tell you ron i've been taping he said i don't give a monkeys you tape what he said let them all hear they'll all be able to pass it round 
it ain't well it wasn't really disgusting but it 
are you ready 
said he wouldn't
i said i got a good joke for you here started to laugh and he said i ain't said it yet
well i didn't tell him it he can wind it just erase it i mean i don't i said i'm alright love just to do all that i've got twenty tapes 
someone asked me whether i thought it'd be a bit of fun but as i say nobody knows who you are or what you've said or anything so it doesn't matter does it
it's the words they're interested in not what you actually say and the 
words that people are using i've got now so i don't even think of it it's just there and i just talk normal that's the idea really and if anybody asks you what you're doing then you tell them and it and you say if you don't wish to be on it well
wipe it off but nobody knows who you are anyway so what difference does it make 
unless it got personal i'd turn it off i mean i mean when we went the estate agents and solicitors 
be alan be alan whicker 
sort of sit there putting what the solicitor said in your 
turn them off
or if anybody told me i mean i wouldn't and talking in confidence about their private life or 
no 
just turn them off and that's it just normal conversations the words that people use in common different areas of the country with accents and dialect and one thing and another it's for the oxford english dictionary the next edition
it is very old 
i'm more than happy with something like that 
do we second hand suite second hand suite the whole lot
it's that 
we go for a second hand suite as well or 
a microwave
go for a microwave or do you just go for
we've got nine hundred pounds approximately after the cooker and the fridge
five hundred pound for carpets leaves four hundred pound two hundred pound for suite and the microwave 
say there's so many combinations that's the thing isn't it
yep
there are so many combinations of what to have what to get what we can't get what we need really i think is what we need is obviously going to be priority isn't it
yes
carpets cooker fridge
yeah
they're the definite needs and erm 
that was eleven hundred pounds
approximately you've got four hundred pound really to play with approximately four hundred pound left over say five hundred pound six hundred for electrical goods
pardon
seven hundred did you say oh no two seventy nine and three twenty something weren't it
yep
er three two
about six hundred
six hundred yeah
six hundred for them two and five hundred for carpets
eleven you've got four hundred pound you got so it's a good second hand one or a cheapy no well it would be a cheapy i told him most of them around about seven hundred and ninety nine 
decent 
a reasonable one i mean you can go up two thousand for a good one but a reasonable one you wouldn't get nowadays under seven hundred and ninety nine 
i think you'd be better off with a with a new cooker and fridge
oh yeah definitely i think 
 you can go second hand 
rather than go second 
but er you know er at least if you go in there at least you've got
got 
got a guarantee for six months 
yeah yeah but 
but at least you know you're going to get a decent amount of 
two or three years on the others
as with a new one you'll probably gonna get four five six seven 
i don't like just i couldn't be like deirdre and put me overall on and in go in without collecting me thoughts getting myself together deirdre never arrives till about three minutes before she gets in the door she's putting her overall onsaying come on ladies its time were but she's putting her overall and on and they all sit there looking at her and so 
they all sit there looking at her and saying bloody hell she ain't got her own hat on we've been here quarter of an hour and she walks in the door takes her coat off and says come on ladies you're suppose to be off your hind by two o'clock leaving here at two 
she's right
i know she's right but she should set an example in some ways mm people are so used to her now they just look at her and carry on talking silly old bugger you know shut up deirdre i'm don't want to do that shouldn't be cos there wasn't much to put on although they left left quite a bit off yesterday they cut short there was five hundred breast portion short and two hundred oyster eggs so deirdre informed me but they injected six hundred too many and four hundred eggs to tescos all quite ridiculous
pardon
put them off today's
i know but it's just waste of time in it they'd been better spent to finish the order that they did have and inject that ha oh be fair to do that to use though no doubt they will pick out all the things we didn't do right bloody should done too many of this or not enough of that

oh there 
what you want what you want could be a now
what was it last year was on thursday

we'll try one to one
of course got to cook so depending on it will be about five o'clock so that they can get washed up

nobody asked for my clock number when mine and stuart's just gave me me ticket
you've just got to give you know we've put by and we said 
nobody put nobody asked for mine or stuart's it's just
when when i went to get my tickets she said 
i had eight 
picking me at half past seven tonight love
oh yeah
yes
and then we'll go for a drink first and then we'll go to the indian restaurant
right
our carl wanted to know what why you were going
did he
yeah
what did he say
he said oh he said what are they celebrating
i said nothing
well he said well it seems funny they're going out doesn't it
well i said well as far as i know i said nothing they're not celebrating anything
should have said to him you never take dad out for a curry so kevin's going
tt
oh gordon
he has taken you out
yeah about four years ago
you're very ungrateful
well he's taken us out when they've been to bloody shop working and come back and i admitted that but i mean just to go out for an evening
i mean he never says to me go and have a do you wanna go for a pint or wanna go for a curry or owt does he
no
well we don't see him much now do we
well i'm not i'm not bothered about it
it doesn't worry me
well who wants to go out with a doddery old bugger like me anyway
surprised kevin wants to surprised kevin wants to go
well it's 
could go on to the rugby and go with them couldn't he
well
eh
yeah 
instead of a doddering old bugger like who's miserable
well well he hasn't got a father so he regards you doesn't he
if you wanna take it that way 
if if labour say get in 
if labour get in and they can't fulfil their promises
yes
like john smith's made promises then that conservatives haven't done this that and the other he must be able to do them now mustn't he
who must
john smith
well erm they they don't know whether they can do it or not do they 
no but he's criticizing the conservative policies and all that and what we will do is this 
i know for investment
yes but they all say that 
industry 
don't they until they get into power 
i know
and and then they all 
they do
back down
they do
yeah
they'll say they they probably haven't got the finances to back up what they what they said they would do
yeah but a a lot of quotes gonna be made to them after aren't there
you know like you said this and you haven't done it you said that and you haven't done it and all that sort of 
yes but once they're in power there's nothing you 
well 
can do about it
oh admittedly no
no
but they must feel a bit stupid to er
well i can't well i mean there's an awful lot i mean would no no matter which political party it is they all make promises but they don't carry them all out
no
course not
but i mean these are these are major things 
getting the economy right
now john smith
but er well john may have 
we'll get the economy right
now if he doesn't get the economy right he's gonna end up with egg on his face and
of course he is
but you tell me how just how is he going to do it
i mean ee they don't explain to you how they're going to do it do they
no
they they just come out er
with statements 
glibly with these these statements 
mm
mm
i'm sure that if there is an easy way of doing it the conservatives would have found out and done it
i don't think there's any any easy way 
i don't see how they're going to do it
no
i really don't
i mean where are they going where are they going to get the extra money from er to pay for the old aged pensioners' er eight pound rise 
mm
or so they say we'll get eight pound
somebody's got to pay for it
so it'll be the working people er probably the the national er health stamp 'll have to go go up
it'll be a sorry day if they get in 
it will gordon
oh
i don't know
you're a real turncoat you are
mm
aren't you
mm
i was listening today to erm a man on the radio and he was only thirty four and he had a stroke and they were saying he they er they were asking him they said well how did it happen
they said did you have any warning
and he said no
none at all he said
i was gardening and he said er er i bent over to do something and he said i just went dizzy he said and i fell over he said and then i realized my right side was paralysed
and he said i was completely confused and i couldn't he said i was trying to shout my wife and erm and er you know my mouth wouldn't work he said but she said fortunately she looked through the window and er found him and they took him to hospital
and they were saying they were saying that you know you associate strokes with older people but there's a hundred young people a week have strokes 
tt
aye
and he said erm like it's the clots to your brains that erm that cause it you know
they said well did you have any warning about it
and he said er no he said i didn't think i had he said but now he said i realized that how i was forgetting er i'd be talking and i'd forget sort of what i was just talking about that split second
mm
and now the stroke has affected him that way 
he can be talking say about a well you know about any er about say a a video recorder or something like that 
mm
and for a minute he can forget that he's talking about it
mm
you know but erm he he's recovered reasonably well in the same you know but
got his use 
very 
back 
er partly back 
partly back 
not fully
you know
thirty four
i know 
i mean you just don't you don't imagine that do you really
no
it's terrible
but a hundred young people a week
i mean i i couldn't believe it when they were saying that 
that's terrible
it is
it's an awful thing 
see i've never i've never across anyone that like know you
what do you mean
well i've known anyone to be five years and no use whatsoever
ah well and i mean aunty lilly was like that gordon
she never got her use back and she never spoke again 
yeah but she didn't well she didn't live long after her stroke did she
oh she did you know
er not as 
mind she was in bed all the time
oh she was in bed all the time
yes
how long did she live after the stroke 
only months weren't it
oh no
oh no
it wasn't months gordon
no
i mean she was in park hospital for so long and then she was transferred to a nursing home in thornton
er do don't you remember us taking iris and ian down to see her
i didn't see her did i
no we didn't go in but iris and ian did
did he
yes
well i i we i i drove them there
you was with me
yeah
yes
well i reckon she lived er a couple of years after the stroke gordon
i mean and she was in a terrible i mean she couldn't even speak
no
i mean er erm and i went to see her in park hospital and she was very very frustrated because she couldn't speak
no
what was she doing in park hospital
she took ill at aunty edith's
well was it edith's
yeah
i i think they'd been on holiday and she took ill on the holiday and and came erm she was stopping at erm edith's and er it happened then
well you know i can't recall any of this 
yes
did we we go to edith's to see her then did we not
no but i went to park hospital to see her
because edith now edith was going away for some unknown reason i don't know she must have been going on another holiday anyhow
no she was in park hospital a long time
that was it because edith was going on another holiday and she was er she wanted someone to go and visit er lilly and i said well i'll go
and i i it was when i had my own car and i drove there
and i wanted to see her
she was very very frustrated cos she couldn't speak
mm
and she couldn't write anything down
i don't think you saw her actually
i don't think i did
i never recall seeing her when she was ill
never
no
no 
well you must have been going during the day while i was at work then
no it was night time i went cos i was working
well why in the bloody hell i didn't go then
why didn't i go with you
i don't know
was it night school or something like that or what
i don't know
i think you d'ya know i think you were at night school gordon when i think about it
i think you were teaching at night school
it must have been something i was doing 
no
i know why gordon
because the the children were small 
one of us had to stay in
oh yes
aye that's right
of course yes
you know i mean they were only small 
aye that's right
did we live in ashton lane then
erm no we were here
were we
yes
well i didn't have my own car in ashton lane
no you didn't
that's right
so we was here
well about nineteen seventy then seventy one
no you got your licence in erm was it it were early in the year when you passed your test
yes i think it was
well it were seventy one
mm
cos didn't you phone me at lillycups to tell me
yes i think i did
yes
yes
well i was only at lillycups from august seventy till august seventy one
yes
only a year
and if you phoned me early in the year it must have been just after we got the v w
yes
i think it was
just a couple 
so 
of months after we got that 
i think it was because er cos we'd got iris' er er triumph didn't we
that's right
yes
soon after that 
yes
i think we did gordon 
and you were driving that about 
that's right
that's right
well carl hadn't passed 
and you went you went in that triumph did you to the
i did
yes
well it's it was later than seventy one you see 
mm 
and you had that car about two years didn't you
oh yes
perhaps a bit longer 
two years
yeah 
because i came i came to er dellasel
yeah 
when carl passed his er to m g s
yeah
do you remember
yeah 
blimey
do you mean must be about twenty years ago then 
yes 
yeah about twenty
this is why you know i i think you should keep i keep diaries from years ago because i know you don't like nostalgia and i don't but it's interesting 
mm mm 
to look up
yes
er events
yes
i mean i've got no diaries dating back that long
no i know
well i haven't
i have no record of anything 
no 
happening then
no
but just one line of things that you know i don't mean a diary where you write a page every night but just two lines you know
yeah
all and what you did and when i got the car the date and when you got that triumph then 
yeah 
you know little just a line 
and then when you look at it er you can recall then
oh yes
other things 
that's right
the one line sort of sets it all off you can remember
that's right
yeah
mm
yes but i remember i can remember edith phoning me and and saying you know she was going away you know is you know could i go down 
and i said yes
mm
i cos i remember coming coming back i got lost 
you know where er that circle is where there's the shops well instead of taking i know instead of taking one road i took another and i got completely lost 
mm
mm
i wouldn't now but then i i i didn't know er round that area
no that's right really i mean if you don't know the area you don't know which road to take on the islands
i know
but i mean you wouldn't have thought that er lilly i mean she had no weight on her or anything like 
no 
that did she
no
she's always been active all her life 
all been active all her life
no you can't understand how these things happen
well they give you all these bloody tips and papers about what to do to avoid this and avoid that 
and what to eat and everything but 
this bloody footballer i mean it's a 
i know 
a really fit man
i know
he's er one artery was seventy percent blocked it was in the paper
yeah
and the other artery was ninety percent blocked
was it really
yeah
yeah
good god
i mean he could have gone any time 
graham sounness i mean he's only thirty eight
could have gone any time with with nothing through his bloody arteries
good god
but that's i didn't know it was that bad
it was in the paper this morning
and er 
goodness me
well he's a he he didn't smoke
no
he was an athlete
he's been an athlete
he obviously ate like everybody else
mm
and he 
i mean 
wasn't overweight in any way 
wasn't overweight what more 
no 
the bloody hell do you have to do
that's incredible that 
see they say it was a it's hereditary
well
cos his father had a bypass didn't he
oh did he
i think some other relative died er 
oh 
youngish
yes
oh well i bet i think perhaps it is really
i know
it's still going 
i know
yeah and you can't you can't understand it can you really
well look at the old lady that walks past here at ninety one
that's right yeah
yeah
and she does all her own shopping
mm
you know i mean she keeps stopping but she's she's remarkable
she really is
mm
but they're few and far between aren't they
when you're like that 
yeah
mm
but what i couldn't understand with this this fella that
this sounness
aye
he he found out cos he went for to for a check up and they took his blood pressure
yes
and well lots of people go and have blood pressure taken they find it's high and they 
yes 
give them tablets
yes
go home
why did they take it a stage further with him
he'd got high blood pressure he wasn't in any pain he's living a normal life
similar to what i was when i went
yes
and they just give me tablets
yes
now why what made them take it to the stage 
well er well first 
where he wanted a heart bypass 
first and foremost he was in a private scheme
well probably that's it then
yeah
and probably because because of his father and er the the other relative having the bypasses done
so they took it 
mm 
a step further but i think probably it's because he was in er er a private scheme
very likely innit
yes
so there's a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tablets who probably really should have a bypass
ah well i well i wouldn't say that really gordon
i mean i think er when your blood pressure was found out and you'd been taking tablets ever so i think it's kept it all under control and you've you we eat a sensible diet
the only the only er thing i complained about with you is is the butter
mm
i don't have that much now 
but i think everything in moderation but you don't eat as much butter now as what you used to
i don't eat that much bread you see 
no
so i i think really and i think what i think with him i think definitely i think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family it runs in the family
mm mm
must be hell of a shock being told
oh god
it must have been
see how much it's costing
two hundred and fifty pounds a night
yeah
phworgh
that's without the operation
yeah
well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then
oh i know
and plus he's he he he he married an heiress you know
did he
er him er they live in spain now
oh er he he's worth a pretty penny is sounness
he went in carl's shop the other the otherweek
did he
yes
mm
must have been looking for a house
carl said he he looked er well er his face did it were very he's gota very poxy skin
has he 
you mm
yes
he was having it done this afternoon weren't he
yeah
some time today
aye
i tell you what that's quick int it though gordon
with only going in last night and
mm
having it done today
it is indeed
i wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he wouldn't have been in a private scheme
he could wait six months couldn't he
well he could have been dead by then
well er yeah exactly that's what they're moaning about int it
terrible
put them on a list and wait
i've never heard so much talk about health as we do nowadays
oh i know
when i was young i i don't remember talking all the time about bloody health and what you should do and what you shouldn't do
no i know
did you
no
but we weren't educated in in in health though 
we just we just lived and that was the end of it
yes but then you see in the in the old days gordon i mean you you were very fortunate if you got three meals a day and and whatever you got you were glad of and used to eat it all
now we're much more affluent and people are educated er
mm
as regards their health
mhm
well having said that gordon your mother lived to a good old age and my mum and my father did
yeah
and they ate all the wrong stuff didn't they 
according to according to what they say now they did 
mm
i know
don't know who to believe really
when you look at when you look at the some all these a lot of these composers and artists who died long ago and you look the birth range there's a hell of a lot at seventy five seventy six

mm
but there's a hell of a lot well into their seventies
you know and they were born early eighteen hundreds
yes

yeah
i know
i know we're living longer now generally but i wonder how much 
i don't know i 
i wonder 
you know 
how much how much i don't really know
cos there's more people now than there was in those days 
yeah there's a lot more people
it's not anyhow i mean it's alright living longer if you if you if you've got all your faculties
mm
and you've got good health and everything
it's no use living a cabbage i don't think so anyhow

somebody's 
pardon

i can't with my habits any more
gambling and drinking 
did you win any money today

i know that 
well bring them back
that's where all these long thin ones have gone

and bring back the glasses
and bring all the glasses back 
i'll tell you what they're 
what are
they do take the bottoms off them
they don't give a fuck 
oh i know 
they do take the bottoms of them barry
oh
well i told you 
well you see you actually see them little punks collecting them up at the end of the night don't you
putting them under their coats like
how how many what did you carry out yourself
tonight
yeah
five bottoms
well that's 
well that 
half a case
and i sold four of those as well like
yeah 
they carry out
and i sold three three double gin three you know 
yeah but you always sell a few to take out don't 
well that's why they brought it 
most probably take out and sell them what's 
yeah 
left at the end of the night
i mean not all our customers are absolutely stupid
buy a bottle at five to two and leave it at two o'clock
it's the nice ones that leave their drink there
mm
i'm amazed they haven't 
well anyway i was talking to er rosette tonight cos i went to the office for some change and i then i had this like
she said i hear the empire or or hear the garden's doing well on a friday night
must have heard about that from alan
he goes it's too fucking dead 
well it's it last day of week 
where 
popping up to christies and just after you go up the top 
no no no where
where are you talking about 
the empire 
but apparently they're doing quite well on a wednesday with the students
students yeah i know
and erm mark was in last week he said 
they're getting six hundred like
well mark said it was mark er guessed about four hundred
he's he he went in last week he went in this week and er 
well paul paul said to me six hundred about seven hundred 
yeah 
normally he said he said well there would be about six hundred
nigel mentioned he told me it was erm er like four five hundred in tt to
not bad though is it
well it's very good innit
i mean on a wednesday
and it's only a quid to get in and it's a pound pound a pint 
two quid and and a drink yeah
but on the other hand they're making a little bit at a pound a pint
well they're making five or six hundred they're bound 
to be gettingonwithit
that's right
that's gettingin the 
i don't think they've got a lot of staff on 
i wouldn't have thought they'd bother with a 
no 
student night having a lot of staff on it's pointless having ah i mean the bouncers in that situation 
well you'd only need one
but we don't need a bouncer on 
except mind you the the rough the erm rugby club gave the band a bit of er a rough seeing to 
what band 
he had some band that were awful apparently and the 
whole of the rugby team were lying in front of stage with their 
they they've never left they were playing the rugby club 
fingers up 
no no no no no
no
university
university rugby club
oh
the uni's
yeah
mhm
yeah
the band went ran off in tears apparently
couldn't cope
seeing the university rugby club i would i would have eh
mm
must be some narky bastards in the rugby club
oh
i can't get it out it's stuck on his collar i hope she comes back for it next week
but six hundred on a wednesday night that's pretty good
mm
does the sugar house get that many people in
no
no
the sugar house only opens er thursday friday saturday
or or we always have done
i mean we we opened originally first year every night of the bloody week and it was pointless absolutely pointless
is that bigger than the empire
i've never been in it
yeah 
no 
er yeah
yes it is
is it
it's legal it's legal 
well it's on it's on a thursday yeah
it's it's legally bigger than the empire but the empire can get more people in cos he's got upstairs and 
yeah 
that 
mm 
see 
but of course erm for licensing they don't take that particularly into consideration up there 
well they half upstairs straight away
yeah
yeah 
so er 
i mean i think i i think the empire legally is well i thought it was nine hundred
seven fifty i think
i can't think er i don't know
i think it's nine hundred
i mean you could you could 
well i thought it was seven fifty 
certainly get seventeen eighteen hundred in there
well yeah
even that bob monkhouse opened up quite 
yeah 
quite nice
yeah
well they'll have the garden won't they
oh yeah
mind you 
probably fucking tell by cos there was i thought 
they 
there was too many
yeah
but i mean they were banging they were banging fifteen hundred in for that disco for the first
mm
few months weren't they
no twelve twelve or thirteen
they never had fifteen
didn't they
i mean the sugar house his capacity's 
just been upped to eleven hundred i think
erm i mean it was always nine hundred but it's been upped to eleven hundred last year i think
well we used to put i mean i put twelve thirteen hundred in the sugar house
but but you it's full at that you know
mm
whereas the the the you you could you could you could fit sixteen seventeen hundred 
no i reckon there was they reckon between a a thousand and eleven hundred for a night you know
but you couldn't fucking move at that 
yeah but it was a it was also a it was a bit of a celebrity i mean it was people people were crushed around bloody hell i mean 
yeah that's right
 yeah 
all the downstairs i mean all the plebs were upstairs all the downstairs was erm
yeah but maybe maybe a hundred people 
mm
i'm sure
i mean i don't know i you see i left i had to come here so i left before bob monkhouse and everything i just i all i did was go for couple of free drinks and plate of free food which i don't think i got
and left
you get a few fucking with the chef
you know deep sea diving at 
yes you would
you you betrayed us then you'd left hadn't you
you'd left me 
i had to leave 
you'd fled us
and gone to work for the opposition
were you well i didn't reckon you were opposition
but i did go out or something
just cos you thought you were 
it's funny though 
just cos you you were coming out with about two hundred and fifty quid a week for working seven nights a week 
no i originally they they were open seven nights a week
i know
no
was it four times a week
and you were secured weren't you secured there
mm
oh 
seven nights a week two hundred and fifty in my pocket guaranteed
going to bed with jean fucking fucking shite
kelly's 
christ
some of the schemes they come up with 
get your blood going 
i mean i'll i'll i'll be interesting to see how they they start next week with a a load of er bands on thursday nights
mm 
i mean they're all chartsey stuff but 
mm 
you know i i that kind of stuff doesn't draw punters generally chart stuff cos the people who go
i dunno i think the young 
the people who are interested
i think the young people go to it like
well yeah maybe
maybe some of that will
yeah
but generally pop poppy type 
a lot a lot of 
top of the pops stuff doesn't in the sense that people who like to go and see live music don't people who like that kind of music prefer the prefer it in a 
yeah 
disco context 
yeah
yeah
not not seeing sort of a live concert
anyway
in fact in fact most of the stuff they don't like anyway
mm
true
well they're not all those appearances are p a it's all gonna be mimed and backing tapes
erm that blooming labour party cancelling that conference on march twenty second and which has 
oh yeah 
messed me up 
cos i was mary wanted to go and see simply red at g mex and last weekend we or weekend before last when they were on their big er we couldn't because i had the kids friday night and the two of them saturday night and it that was the two nights

i thought she was going to be meeting him next weekend then 
all the dirty tricks start now though

well if i had a million invested have it all invested 
yep
yep
i agree
seriously i'd fucking have it out of there everything i own

er i remember you said about 
full sunday times tomorrow major expose on the the the labour leaderships ties with a moscow moscow company
did you see it
yeah

i think it's about time i got my share of the 
well who's doing it tomorrow what they call it
report he's doing tomorrow
oh 
er sunday times 
personal view of the files on 
typically 
dennis healey fuck
he's gon na out with some stick 
kinnock was saying to erm the candidates you know we i realize that a lot of you are getting it rough at the moment cos there's about five labour 
yeah 
candidates all been arrested in the north 
yeah 
west mysteriously 
but er jean not a 
yeah
derek there's somebody derek 
derby 
derby that's right
blackpool's under investigation
anyway so erm he said but you know he was saying to them that er it's not just at the bottom end he said in our village in wales we've got the sun have now positioned two reporters who have lived in the village the these they sit in a car outside his house day and night 
photographing who comes in
they've been to his little boy's primary school interviewed the teachers and headmistress and all the school friends and everything just trying to get a dirty story 
well that but your main areas will be gonna be before
so 
what 
we're just saying main area's 
you ought to save them wooden type of things for it
you know the
yeah
yeah 
should have bought them for 
er yeah i mean it's it's 
are they expensive though 
expensive it is very expensive
well you could have your dance floor actual dance floor whatever couldn't you
and then something
mm
well it's 
you can make it different like and make it sort of still a dance area
yeah
something like they have at chapel 
yeah what have they got down in there 
just the wooden floor 
it's just just a little a little sort of parquet 
small 
flooring type of thing 
oh
that type of floor yeah
and carpet all round it and just a
oh it's carpet is it round 
yeah 
it
but it's only a tiny area 
yeah but 
isn't it
yeah
but as i say in the sugar house so i mean we've we all we did was was we the the big central area we just literally sort of lino type floor and carpeted round the edges 
round the edge
and into the bar area
and it's a i mean you get four hundred people on the dance floor in the sugar house
erm
where is this sugar house
it's in erm
in lancaster 
behind waring and gillow
how do you get to that 
say the rest of us didn't know where it was 
up up the alleyway by the yorkshire you got yorkshire house there 
ah
yes 
waring and gillow and it's up that alleyway there 
oh is it in there 
it's it was the architects' department erm till they go like you know till they palatine hall erm it used to be the architects' department
we bought it off the city well michelin bought it off the city council and they gazumped us and erm but we we have tables and chairs onto the dance floor on other nights and just pull them back when it's clear 
yes 
saturday night there's gonna 
yeah 
be a thousand people in
that's how we used to do it
ah yeah
so er can they get yeah they get eleven twelve 
how many's 
er i think they it's nine hundred 
the 
isn't it
is the like legal limit 
they've they put like twelve thirteen 
on a night
they've put twelve thirteen hundred in 
but when when they can but you've in the empire if you if you've i don't know actually before they before they messed about with all the raised seating and everything if it had been just left open like the old floral hall like it was you'd have got seventeen 
i know 
eighteen hundred in
with a balcony
erm i mean as an as the old floral hall they must have had
mm mm 
they must have been putting two thousand in you know 
yeah 
in those days
yeah
yeah
well i mean they'll all be packed up in the bars upstairs wouldn't they and everything 
yeah 
you know leaning over the balcony and all that sort of er 
yeah
mm
but i'd er i'd you know the way they've the way they've got it now i don't i don't know
well
but you know i mean actually the other the other aspect of it anne if you if you pull this out you could be talking about hosting small conferences and that 
yeah 
couldn't you
definitely
cos if you're looking at a two hundred capacity conference for er 
yeah
easy-peasy
no messing 
that that just makes the total picture just different altogether
so right so that's that little job 
you 
sorted out 
probably need to 
i'm 
get 
i'm gonna play with that and see what 
probably need to get ken's 
we can do with it then 
probably need to get ken's permission
who
mr 
ken's permission
what for
structural alterations 
what for 
for that 
mind you actually 
i've gotta be i won't actually do it i'll just come in run a just give it complete customers and and help 
they'll say well you it's awful you're awfully sorry but it's 
on what 
actually from the original structure i mean it's it's it was half that size anyway
mm
well as i say you can see where it was it's that diamond 
well why do you 
i think 
did you have get his well it int structural is it 
no
i wouldn't
no it int because structural's walls
oh that's get his permission for nothing
well he won't know i don't i don't think he dare show 
at the moment 
his face at moment he hadn't been anywhere round to since all this happened before christmas 
obnoxious little man int he
he's a ferret 
mm
i get on very well withhim though
so what is so there's nothing to the other side just apart from this big room
yeah
but and a bar
what and that in there 
yeah
so that's that one 
there's a massive room with twelve snooker twelve snooker tables 
well yeah well well 
in
er just maybe the size of this 
right
it is the size 
well no 
of this 
it is exactly 
well i mean 
eh
yeah
it is the size of this yeah
yeah 
right
so we'll want 
and what they've what they've got they've got the bar in a far bottom corner
you used to go in to play snooker didn't you
i did
disco nights
when we have a when we were talking to them and we had the door through and my snooker got really good
mm
we did we had a snooker table at home and my snooker will never get good
i used to end up hitting them like a golf ball 
used to go bloody berserk
good with iron and everything you know
oh
them were the days
mm
i hated it 
what
when you were at 
do you fancy a quick game then 
no
yeah
might do in a minute
well i shall go because if that fella's been from if that fella said i didn't have a job i'll be jumping up and down like a what d'ya call it 
oh alright
okay
i'm i'm going to erm we'll make that into something american
but i don't know what
have to think of that 
we we will i'm just saying we do wanna get into cocktail and 
ranch house 
oh
eh
said a ranch house from 
sod off 
no we don't wanna be looking at 
you see some fucking morons we get in 
no we wanna be
that's who we need to advise us don't we
we need geoffrey along to advise us 
yeah 
geoffrey how would you 
mm 
how do you americanize this 
bastards stealing our customers last night
yeah 
yeah
criticizing a 
where's my customers 
criticizing a don't want them in town and then put functions on and cheap beer for them when they come
well they do that don't they
i mean they're all you know 
supposed to be four hundred in the ranch house last night
on the ground like 
we need we needs lots of piles of steaming horse manure and things don't we around and 
stuff like that 
gotta get it right
no
that's for frontier land
we are
we are erm
thought it was hardly 
we're boston
yeah definite 
that's right 
we're near boston 
yeah
cheers
yeah
yeah
no
why
does it
punters wouldn't go go for it
no
no i don't no no no no no but i know it wants to be erm
eh
have you seen the new rules on er bar staff 
no
they're not allowed to smoke
oh yeah 
no you're not 
no no no
no
full stop 
anywhere 
yeah
not you can't even wander outside 
so i go doo doo doo doo doo
that's right
and you've gotta wear gloves to use the till
you what
you can't you can't handle money and
and serve 
pull pints 
who says that 
this is health and environment it's a new 
when's it in operation
er er i don't know actually
i've got it in disco club mirror it's the front page out the 
oh i couldn't have that 
grantham 
they're treating 
got to have a look at this 
they're treating alcohol as food
yeah
so all the hygiene things on food apply to alcohol 
oh i know that 
so you can't handle you can't handle 
you're gonna have to have somebody else to take the money won't you
fucking cashier
you'll have to have a cashier
you can't do it though
you can't have it'd mean one to serve and one take the money 
it's fucking ridiculous
say if you're if you're really busy at the bar just taking your gloves off and fucking putting them on 
oh aye you're gonna do it aren't you
well what we'll do is we'll do we'll just have a pump at the side of the till
well you 
there's punters on the door 
yeah you know like
fucking 
you know like it is 
oh no it isn't
you wanna go 
alright then
or nuclear license opens 
no just ask them if it's effective with your license just you know sort of as you come 
mind you one 
from the sale
volks volks took them 
we're sterilizing the bar with those 
volks took them into not volks er what they called
somebody took me to see one of their pubs in liverpool it was wonderful
where the shutters are
yeah
all just hardboard like that with just a little o like that and you you you shout a pint of beer and you pushed your money through and then a beer came out the other side 
bet it was erm 
it was rough 
yeah 
waste of time though innit
it was a bit of a rough area
what type of beer are you getting
no and a pint of sherry
yeah and plastic glasses as well 
yeah 
oh my
great 
i mean the only way you could do that would be if you had a till at one end and people bought whatever they wanted and were given a voucher and you walked down the other end and exchanged 
mm 
it for drink
that's the only way you could actually make that work at all 
yeah but just think of how much messing about there is 
ah
it'd be unbelievable 
i mean it'd be two forty we'd be round the bloody bend 
yeah but it's somebody sitting in an office innit deciding this 
yeah but who who do you you know why 
sitting in a suit in a nice office saying wo
this is a good idea
you know they don't serve behind the bar on a saturday night 
they want somebody here from the for half an hour and them not being served first 
here
you know what happens d'ya know what happens then they'll get people 
like
yeah
people will get so antiseptic that they'll not be able to stand any sort of germs of any sort
that's

the two companies concerned are trying to record the spoken word
we don't want you on tape 
so the thing the thing to do is to sort of dot around in the conversation things like antidisestablishmentarianism
and hopefully 
this will get modern usage of words
of one of the words that she was talking about people have started using wicked for a normal phrase
i mean it doesn't mean what it says in the dictionary any more
that's a really wicked thing to say he went no it's not it's bad it's not wicked
he thinks of wicked as being good he doesn't cause mandy says wicked
yeah
well that's the idea anyway
he goes round saying wicked it's his favourite word 
are you going to go to sleep eh

i haven't watched top of the pops
will sit there cringing said i can't believe they put this rubbish on terrible
who was on it
don't know who was on it actually
well she doesn't like m c hammer he was on and then there was one week with germans on it and it was erm it's a german group that used to be popular and haven't done a song for ages
it wasn't the robots was it
yeah the robots
i mean it was just the words they were using i mean oh it makes you cringe oh and then that er girl oh she's done quite a few things recently
she sings much better than she talks
back to my diet today
thank you very much yes i will actually
no it's not my day to diet been been naughty today
oh dear
pop him on the shoulder
 so did you enjoy paul simon
yeah
she was about to but she found a sticker on book 
she comes out well ontape doesn't she
who charlotte
mm
i didn't realise how clear her speech was until i heard it on the tape
it's really quite good actually
not bad 
oh we'll do this one again 
drop off 
cos it's lights and things isn't it
she was looking at er lights in sainsbury's the other day
it looked like that didn't it
carol was swaying at her
you missed that 
i just swayed at her and she 
it's conway twitty isn't it
is it
oh no
how far back does this go i suppose early fifties
er nineteen fifty six
i remember conway twitty
oh yes
you were in your cradle
elvis didn't he 
i don't think he ever recorded it i think he just used to sing it at his er sort of cabaret
well so many of these songs have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that that
because there's one there one on one of these that er either paul simon or art garfunkel or someone can't remember which one probably art garfunkel as paul simon does all his own doesn't he
well he has done other people's
well there's one on there i can't remember
like for instance the er what do they call those two
oh the two brothers
in the
everley brothers
the everley brothers that's it
you know wake up little suzie
oh yeah
well simon and garfunkel did that 
wicked far out
it's a groovy record this 
shut up 
can't remember which one it is but i'll recognise it when i hear it
he's doing very well isn't he
he is
have to employ him full time
he's always quite good
i just can't believe how daft he is
i suppose you like that film 
yes 
forget it
you're not having cake
does she like cake
well she's looking at it 
so how's things down at the 
not too bad 
quite good actually 
yeah
keeping him busy out on estimates and
yeah he's out all this week
well my dad won't pass them onto terry
me dad said he's had enough well we were debating whether to give it to you or not
but i thought well if terry notices he might 
well in fact two really big estimates 
who terry
yeah
and one wanted re-estimating the other one wanted a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done
we give them a provisional kind of price and not really gone into it in detail 
so she had a list of about five things she wanted sorted out and she said so far we were the cheapest
but she's got about six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes
so i worked out and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all down to terry to sort those out 
and they're both about two to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pounds worth of work
well you can't afford to lose them can you
no
so what's going to happen then
god knows
he said i asked asked well i left a message on saturday for him to sort them out didn't i
he already knew about that 
and then i asked my father on tuesday to remind him and he said he'd already said he'd fetch them in on tuesday
and he my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning
but he's he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices
so i don't know
well i mean he'd done he's done this first estimate these are all just polishing touches cos people are obviously interested in you know they're well keen on our prices
they can't pursue it till we come back to them
they're not pursuing it until we put these things out 
my father just turned round i've had enough of it if terry's not going to do the estimate he passes them on to brian
i said yeah then i get into trouble with them for not passing estimates to terry and then there's an argument
if he if he says anything to me i'll just have to tell him
but he's not doing the estimates he's been given and he can't afford to throw money away 
it's cos he's working for him at the moment money
he always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he hasn't worked for him
he forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings the other way 
i mean brian's pulled in a lot of work
lot of people kind of saying come back again on thursday so he's he's 
if we got terry to do that we'd be well away 
they they would love him i mean one of them it was annoying really cos terry's just not pulling his weight 
i don't understand it if i live to be a hundred i won't understand it
and also it's cos that you know after we had that row about terry after bank holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop and er he's already owing brian a day
guess who's doing the extra day got my dad to cover a day
and then he takes a day off bank holidays
and he can't do it because my dad 
but then tomorrow he's actually doing his own work
so he could easily have 
and on monday 
so who's covering tomorrow
well my brother's covered practically all week and brian's doing tomorrow
terry phoned up asking what tuesday morning about quarter past eight said who was covering 
and he said well my father is doing today i can't do today i'll do it friday and i shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you shouldn't be going in
i mean he hasn't been in the shop once this week
somebody's got to tell him to 
so do dave and terry in the shop 
they have the records 
and it hasn't been sorted yet
oh no
he's got the gall to phone up on tuesday and say eileen can't do a day we're going to be short of eileen
so the answer is to just phone them
i can't do it
i'm not doing it 
what's the point of carrying on like that 
well he's going to carry on like that isn't he
not unless someone puts their foot down 
and if your father is currently taking your side of things worth sounding him out as to how far he'll take 
ah 
whilst he's in the mood
yeah
he's not being that much 
you sure
mmm
he's probably only in the mood cos he's probably upsetting them on his night out cos they go out in the evenings
on a wednesday evening don't they
cos terry 
i mean wouldn't he rather have terry as a sort of permanent worker anyway
it's not being fair 
do any work
oh what your dad
pauline's dad er 
too expensive i think
terry uses the shop to get extra money every so often uses my dad ticking over running when he 
why 
he does get the offer i mean 
two months and she phoned up and i kind of made out it got lost in the post
i erm got check you've got two days you've got give me the estimate it's got to be on because she's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent
and he actually got that one done
do you know it was only five lines 
i mean i could have made it up it was that easy
so i sent that off
she was in firstthing i mean i sent it off that evening she was in first thing the next morning yes that's fine 
so he's got that job and another one 
she's trying isn't she 
i don't understand why it surprises you that's what gets me
i mean 
it's normal behaviour 
charlotte's done it too 
can you pass me that er sheet 
this
is that your reading
that's not your regulations you have to read is it
oh no that's a 
i was going to say that doesn't seem very thick 
no that's to do with this tape
oh i tell you what is quite funny these the act
mmm
oh
hereby enacted her gracious majesty you know etcetera etcetera
what was it the lords temporal and spiritual that's what they call themselves
now that is that's 
yes
yeah i realise and i hope i don't come into contact with too many acts of parliament 
oh we had someone round to see the house yesterday
oh yeah
they came twenty minutes early there's brian up in the shower there's me stuffing things in the cupboard under the stairs
that's an old trick 
i said to danny don't open the door

meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
just a minute get some of this
meow
mum
mm
what do you like
that 
what
what's in here
what's in there we've got biscuits i'm just going to get some raisins alright they're just up here you stay there
here we are
i want raisin
you want some now do you
alright i can open this up i got the little box there you are just a minute and oh charlotte oh you are a menace there you are now you be quiet for a minute will you
let's get some peas i think that's it then
right o k now we can go now we can go home
four add four and then 
four add four equals eight
two times four equals eight right
yeah like that 
and then two 
and two times four is eight
erm i didn't write it like that then 
right
share the total of fives
yeah i done yeah i done 
er 
five five five is fifteen 
five add five add five
erm is fifteen
and then erm 
right
is fifteen
and then 
and sixes 
sixes six 
add six add six 
add six 
add six
is thirty six
right
six times six is thirty 
i've done that one 
sixes
that's it
okay
erm this
i'll leave that out 
leave that out
add them up
mm
that much closer can use those pictures
take a look
are they near the box
yeah
is that right
four 
four is twenty
so it's four so
four times five is
twenty
four times five equal twenty
er two times six equals twelve
er four times three equal twelve
er two additions left 
alright
those two add 
so it's like one two one two and one there and but put like erm seven add seven add seven is 
is twenty one
yeah
seven add seven add seven is twenty one 
one 
and three times seven
right
is twenty one and do it that way five and fives
okay
two addition questions 
hang on 
two yeah but you've got right two multiple and two addition equations
not equations
you told us this 
but like these these are equations
so two addition equations er three times seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one
right
oh
so but you can also go 
yeah
yeah add three 
three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one
do it that way on 
do you follow 
yeah 
me
yes i do
right
two multiplication 
yeah
and two addition 
two addition 
right
so you like you 
yes that's right
then it's like erm 
one 
seven times three and three times seven 
and three times seven
that's right
and you do the same there 
same on the adds 
and then this we do like
right she wants currency in two divisions in each right
so it's one two three four 
that multiplication is a 
yeah well divisions okay so it's twenty one shared by say if that's one two three four five six int it
oh i know what i've got 
six times three is eighteen or three times six is eighteen
i know what i've done
i've put the i thought it was er okay
six
and division is shared by 
so you got to do eighteen shared by six is three and eighteen
have you got
shared by three is six
so like you go one two three four five six six times you swap 
three 
six times three 
times three is eighteen 
is three times six 
six
yeah and and you got 
six times three and three times six 
and division is eighteen shared by three is six and eighteen shared by six is three
yeah
got it
i cannot read 
three sixes are eighteen
you got it
and you do the same there
hang on 
i haven't finished thirty three 
one yet
that's what i don't get 
why do multiplication equation for this similar line i don't get how you do that 
is it would you like us to put
it's fours int it
it's fours 
no two four six eight ten twelve
yeah
it 
that's twos
no but it's going to fours look
it's going to fours
alright
going into fours
what would i put 
er one four is four two fours are eight and three fours is twelve
as this is been shared by lines int it
yeah and it's on that one
you do it like that do you
yeah cos it's being shared by 
oh
so it's i would say that is er nine times four equals thirty six
and on that one is er sixty three shared by nine six time sixty three divided by nine
four
no
sixty three divided by nine is six
write six through it
ten six innit
no it's ten sixes
no no wait a minute
nines
what should nine times ten emma 
one nine is nine two nines are eighteen three nines are
twenty seven
four nines are thirty six five nines are forty five six nines fifty four seven nine are sixty three
oh thank you
right
yeah seven nines are sixty three
hang on a minute
six nines are
seven nines are sixty three
hang on a minute
seven
seven nines are sixty three 
sixty three 
yeah
you work them out like that look
yeah
well seven nines well ee er it takes you so long 
look one one nine is nine
yeah
two nines are eighteen
so that one there is sixes into thirty six 
i know
but i still don't get what you have to write
well multiplication equation for this number line i would say is er i've already told you that 
no but i don't know what i have to i have to write 
eight times four equals thirty six
don't get it
because it's one two three four five six seven eight no sorry nine times four is thirty six
nine times four equals thirty six
like this look
write it out on a piece of paper and you'll and i'll write them down
no
you do it yourself
i've told you what to do
you do it like that 
i don't get it though
i'll tell you if it's right
i'm just writing the answers out for you
i told you what to do
that's lazy
int it
you crafty cow 
if i give you a bit of paper and the lot yeah well you know what to do and go to school and fill them in 
couldn't it 
no 
hey 
right
your dinner's ready now 
she says to me i've explained to her how to do it and she says i'll give you a bit of paper you just write down the answers

well i just kind of was running round the shop because i was 
you got the first one you could see
i had to go and collect grandma you see to take her to the station and i didn't have an awful lot of time so i just sort of ran round and collected whatever i got
cos we wouldn't have wanted grandma to miss her train would we
if we did 
no bus 
what miss the train
no bus
she'd have to get the next one
she had to go on a bus actually
get the train 
cos they don't have trains from redditch 
mummy 
do you know why 
mm 
pass the marge
they only had them from
daddy's got the marge

i hope the wind doesn't blow them over
be a pity 
there's at least one blown over there isn't there
oh where
oh yeah
where
we'll have to go and collect it put it in a vase on the side
where's one blown over 
there look 
a new one
mm 
mm
it's so windy at the moment
march winds
the others seem to have stood up quite well over on the other side 
where
where 
one of them's dead 
which one's dead
the one which is pointed erm straight ahead
mm
see what you mean
it's a bit dead 
it is
looks as if it and the wind's got it again 
mum it's not very nice when the wind hits it is it mum 
no
still we can always pick them and bring them inside 
i remember doing that once
i remember 
finding one and putting the vase on there 
mm
so where is it now
it will be dead by now
you're talking about last year aren't you
last year's flowers aren't around now 
here you are
right
thank you
these are the same bulbs though that have made a new flower this year 
where's the marmalade
i took a bit
why they keep on making new bulbs
they do it well they do it every year
can i have some marmalade please
ah 
the daffodils over there in that little bed seem to be a bit later than all the others i don't know 
 have some marmalade
have some marmalade
i'm doing it a funny way this time
i'd of thought they would have got just as much sun and rain as everything else 
that's a little one 
mum
look what i've done
marmite 
mm
very posh
candles 
do you usually do that 
if you ask mummy she'll 
what do you want me to do 
i didn't make that
oh good
what do you want
do you want some er marmite on it
you did 
mm
gone a funny shape 
daddy hasn't seen the new rosie and jim
true 
lot of things daddy hasn't seen
i know
inspector morse
i know
few weeks before we have time 
have you got lots of spare tapes
no
 we'll have to have another one next wednesday
are they on every week or are they once a fortnight 
i'm not sure actually
and you haven't seen the the puppet show
i haven't seen one about a puppet show
is that where 
mm
rosie and jim mm 
rosie and jim went to a puppet show did they
they go to stratford
yeah and a lion 
stratford
do they
and there's a lion is there
and a and a lion 
he took an omelette
omelette
an omelette 
it was quite good actually
and a man came back and 
oh
and went back 
pardon
skinlid
the skin
well he's called skinlid
is he
i don't know
i didn't watch it that closely 
havesome more tea 
ate it all up 
mhm
so if it's a puppet show did rosie and jim do some puppeting puppet
no
they were in the audience shouting and cheering from what i saw 
where they 
mhm
then they went round the back though didn't they
did they 
mm
they run round the back and played with the puppets
when the show was ended 
nobody mentioned that they were puppets themselves 
that's what i call a miracle 
i do that 
i don't think they like it
mm
it was nice to see stratford
i wonder if that they filmed that at the time when the boat was in stratford
do you remember when we went to
yeah
yeah 
we nearly went to see it but we missed 
yeah
cos it had moved by the time we got there 
so it might be then they might have taped it
mm
it could well have been 
but mum it's a bit late from that 
well it's always takes a long time
they they do these things months beforehand
and then it comes on the television later on 
how to get to know about these things 
mm
this chap we were sitting next to involved in all these canal projects 
oh yes that's right
he was
apparently he's a director of various canal preservation bodies and things 
oh
he was certainly into canals in a big way 
yeah
yeah he is 
mm
you'll have to get to know is he in your 
no he's at solihull 
oh solihull
what was he called
jonathan
jonathan
he was a pleasant chap i thought
oh yes
as these chaps go 
it was interesting discussing various chaps after 
oh right
only just sort of see them occasionally to get the inside stories to 
have drunk 
mm
how's julia
she was okay this week
well she's a totally snowed under 
well it's not 
with work 
surprising
like i had to give her some top priorities yesterday as she wasn't going to be about
actually she did very well on one of those 
she did far better 
did you tell her 
oh yes
yes
well i made sure my boss told her that's 
cos he was desperate for cos he needed an answer for monday morning for dave 
it's going to be thinking about science
dave's erm wife produced a baby last week
oh
so he's having a week off you know to change nappies or whatever 
it might be or it might not 
mum is the video on 
i just i only pressed hold nothing else
well you're not to 
well since someone else switched it off i should think
why
i'm not quite sure what happens you see 
that's why
i just pressed but cos there's a little line 
hear the sound of the video
when
well i can hear it now
oh
yeah i'm wondering whether it's playing to itself with the television off 
do you think that's likely
or does it not do it
no cos it's not got the aerial it would do 
it would do 
would it 
oh dear
it's not got the aerial in
no
shouldn't 
it is it's on it's on the video 
it's just that i can actually hear it
i can actually hear the motor on 
oh
on turning round 
it's on the video
i presume what happens when it's not on it's all geared up ready to 
mummy
daddy 
it's on the video
what's on the video
telly
yeah 
yeah when er all which is on now is the blue button
right
it's the blue 
the blue button's on but nothing else
right
the blue button's okay
where are you going to
cloth

mum why aren't you gonna put your microphone on 
well it might as well stay there
why
well it can hear us all then 
no that noise daddy
yes
what was that 
isn't that it's that
ah but that wasn't on before was it
cos mummy only just come down for breakfast
no just remembered and rushed off and to get it 
but it's true it does make a noise
there's lots of noises lotsof electrical things
see me
the fridge made some really weird noises yesterday
i thought oh what's going on 
can you see me now 
can i see you 
oh was it vibrating 
there's a little bit more just there
yeah
it does
it a load or 
is it knocking on something
oh

oh it's the clip
he's been playing with it he's bent it out so it

macdonalds
mac 
erm have you got the purse mummy
erm i don't know
have you got some money
i haven't got any money 
it's alright
i've got loads of money somewhere
it's just a matter of 
it's stopped raining
good
has john got a new car do you think
oh well i saw that on friday
in fact yesterday we said i wonder if he's got a new car or whether he's got visitors
i should imagine it's a new car 
very posh isn't it
is it new
i mean
it's j reg is it
i i i i told you to
will it fit in the garage 
it's a bit bigger than our ford escort
it won't mummy
i don't think it will
if it doesn't mum anyway it wouldn't fit in the garage because there's another car in there 
oh that's a point 
that's a bit tricky
well we think that that might be a new car
yeah we think it's 
cos we're nearly there 
we're not nearly there 
we haven't even started 
nearly there 
got to be quick 
did you actually go to sleep mummy
i did
did you 
i was absolutely whacked out 
you've done very well 
well i haven't
you've done all the meals 
dad could you walk it to macdonalds
well you could
it would be a little bit far for us
but we could if we needed to
wouldn't be too bad cos you'd go down by the jolly farmer
yeah
you'd have to walk like gemma walks to school wouldn't you
mm
where does gemma live
gemma lives 
yeah near macdonalds
near macdonalds dad
she lives right near macdonalds doesn't she
she does actually
wonder if she goes to macdonalds every night for her tea
no
but she could walk it from her house couldn't she
she could 
because it's not far
yeah all she has to do is go go round her bit round just a normal road across the road down a little bit and she's there 
mm
it's not very far daddy is it daddy
a teeny bit 
it's only round the corner from her isn't it mum
it's only 
i found it over here
i can't see it
there it is
there it is
there's a lot of people there
do you think we'll get a seat
ooh there's a lot of cars
i see macdonalds
there's not normally that many people there are there
no
it's
what
it's a bit full
oh it looks crowded
perhaps there's a party 
it's not a party 
perhaps there's only one person in each car at macdonalds
that's true 
i can't think that one person in a car on their own would want to go to macdonalds too often 
like a mum or a dad or 
everybody must have thought what a dismal day this is
mm
let's got to macdonalds for our tea
mm it is quite full though 
how do you know which way 
it is
are we gonna get i don't think we're gonna get in
course we are
what
i've never known it that full before 
where to park 
there's a space 
there aren't any spaces 
well just keep going round
there was some space at the other end actually
there's a space
just missed a space
i don't think we did tim 
no there weren't any
no
i think there's one just over here
oh 
how you space 
where 
there
that's the one i saw when i was coming in
don't know if you're meant to use it
well

i'll go round the door
appearances at noon and three pm
i thought the man was dead
i'm going out here

french fries
this thing is it on off 
has it been on 
it's not been on no i've just switched it on
right toast and marmite times two
i think everything on this erm machine is to do with food don't you
probably is 
you need to sort of stop and talk when you have food
yes 
yes please cup of tea are making it then good
i did manage to sort out the food for tomorrow and
did you really
that's very clever
well i thought 
did you manage to do alright 
yeah
found 
i mean pinchedone of for starters that makes a difference
did you try it did you 
no 
ah ho 
a pathetic film on i don't 
ah 
know what it was about but it was pathetic 
ah 
mm
what's happening tomorrow
what do you mean what's happening tomorrow
well what is it tomorrow morning and evening and things 
what
what is it tomorrow morning and evening and what are we going to do in the afternoon without 
i know we'll cope but what are you going to do
are we inviting anyone
i know we're not inviting anybody for lunch christmas day couldn't cope with that but it would be quite to have them in the afternoon can't cope with the people
oh yeah
suppose we should do something yeah
well that's what i was thinking perhaps we could go with somebody somewhere
you know like by a canal or something
perhaps well if it's snowing it won't be quite the same 
that's right 
conducive to tripping about
but if it's quite nice weather it would be nice to invite somebody along i expect 
they could just 
stratford
yeah the stratford warriors running about every six weeks something like that 
is it six weeks since we saw the last one then 
they didn't they they have them more frequently now and they're getting even more and more infrequent now for the rest of the year
mm
and next one 
that's mother's day twenty second
is it
no
mother's day a fortnight
twenty ninth
somebody will organize a party for tuesday 
yeah they want a party piece on tuesday
it's alright you don't have to of cake
if i don't bake them now my mother
yeah well tell your mother
i'll have to 
yeah i will 
get one
and it better be a nice one
pop into marks and spencers they have some amazing shapes in marks and spencers that the children will enjoy
really
mind you it might be expensive
tesco's are probably cheaper
you remember that tom and jerry i got for tim
because i couldn't be bothered to cook it
well leave it up to me i'll see what i can get i'll get for the party 
thank you dear 
is that alright
yeah
i'll get you some
and i'll just make the rest of the with salad in
you're not supposed to 
i've told you what we're gonna for christopher haven't i
i know he went to school to do 
yeah 
housework
is that naughty 
thursday morning
right christopher will be back too
i wish i could i'd like to 
you what
out at the meeting again on monday night
on monday
where are you going monday
going to sue's house
oh right the big housewife
the housewife mhm
like cooking this week
ah i'm having jane for a piano lesson aren't i
what day
which day
monday
are you
oh well 
so that fits in quite well i couldn't remember what i was doing on monday but we said sort of tentatively monday would be probably quite a good day i think
better than thursday anyway
so could tuesday night be inspector morse night
yeah cos my mum will be here then
oh right can we not take her home 
unpaid 
well she'll 
we shall see 
have been here all day won't she
so she might want to go home 
she wants to tell us all about her wedding 
could you tell her we're going to watch inspector morse 
for the third or fourth time
will she have watched inspector morse
she won't of watched it cos it's bound to be on a wednesday night
does she like inspector morse
i don't think she watches it normally
no she probably doesn't like it
a bit spicy 
i bet she would she loves anything like that 
bit of a body 
mind you it might be too complicated
it was i remember reading in the paper that it's been it's been filmed at a house which no one's ever been allowed to go in even the great sort of one of these country mansions it was not 
right
and even people who write about 
if it was not it can't be again they're always going in there 
well that's fine 
it was some country mansion in oxfordshire you know
mm
it's as you come off the 
and how did 
and 
they get permission then
they somehow managed to persuade the owners apparently it was and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historians who write about famous buildings even they had been refused access
where is it
somewhere in oxfordshire
oh
they don't know where
oh 
so
this was about last week's episode
i think it was about last week's but they seem to imply that it was last week's episode that would
oh
do it
we seem to have got one spare video if we don't get it watched before wednesday
alright
well that's the only chance
oh yeah cos we're going to maryland tomorrow
your dad
mm
erm not it wasn't about your dad it was about my birthday cos 
cos 
he'd realized that it was my birthday and what did i want
so i said send me a cheque and i'll go and shop
and
and last week cos she's quite generous isn't she
she is a bit but it's 
no i didn't say anything 
i think that's the thing 
so your dad sent a cheque
anyway i asked her if she'd heard from your dad and she has heard from your dad apparently on friday he went to the consultant
mm
and next week he's got his first well she didn't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy
and she said he has to go trotting to exeter two or three times a week now
mm
i don't know how long it's going to go on for or what it is exactly but i thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see 
mm
but at least things have moved and at least they've gone round 
so i'm pleased really are you
interesting that they've done it so quickly isn't it
after seeing him because he thought that once he'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started but they must have got themselves over that 
yeah
well i mean everyone 
yeah
i think 
gotta get moving 
and presumably whatever it was the gp had give him has had upset that thrombosis again
i don't know whether to ring him tonight oh it's too late tonight now 
it's much too late
perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up 
well they love talking to them on the phone don't they
i know they do
we could can prime them up on what to say and types of things to talk about so they don't get moaned down or something 
bogged down 
so he's had to go in what did you say
three times a week
i don't know she just said 
something like that 
a few times a week and i think it sounded like three cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and everything
mm a trial
well i hope not i mean no he won't be able to drive 
but presumably your mum can do that for they've got hundreds of people there he's always driving people everywhere 
that's right 
so i don't see why they can't drive him
i'm sure they will 
yes 
cos they're very good aren't they
i mean look at that woman doing her er from the from the church
at times like this it would be nice if we lived nearer could help out 
it would nice if we lived there but we can't so 
it's about 
and write as well
yes
double dose 
yes
and pulled out 
well it's sort of pulled out but at least it's 
we'll be paying for it as well
and it's hard as well
we've been paying anyway so it must of you know
what does erm you see er eileen's and she's having chemotherapy isn't she
by by medication is 
that right
well she takes all these tablet things 
that's right she has a sort of massive dose every now and then
and that makes her feel what
she's not in pain is she
more sort of dopey
i wouldn't care if they made me dazed 
yeah 
yeah
i dunno
not gonna 
difficult to know 
oh yes that was it
i wonder how bad it is that feeling's like we don't really know how bad it is do we
no
perhaps he will be able to say you know
but whether he'd tell us over the telephone you think ask
i think he would wouldn't he
i think so
cos we've got the agm in two weeks time
mm
and we voted all these people that are here 
what type of this 
well you just 
it doesn't matter 
you just come along don't you find out 
what we do with all the money and you find out who's doing what and who's doing you know
mm
it's it's quite exciting really
if you 
but i've 
these little things 
you couldn't show me something 
alright
you see cos it's
we're confusing her now cos 
this is where we're going not towcester alright
this page
this yes we're taking over a couple of 
when when's that then 
places in leicestershire 
when is it 
and we're going on a coach so you don't you 
have to worry no
oh
and it'll be really rather dolly we'll have a little holiday you see together and we sort of go teaching together and 
how long is it for 
it'll on a friday afternoon friday night 
yeah 
you know five half five-ish
and what do you do

and

well we've never been this place before but we've been on a similar do

yeah 
cos i cos i had
you if i don't i 
we are bossy is the word

i really think she's good for but ooh i get out of breath but 
well you tell 
by the lakeside you know it's like a big 
oh right
and then she's 
i know 
i think she's got to know well enough that
we've only got little 
yeah
i know 
yeah
mm
since i mean when it was on the back i thought oh i don't know how you get used to each since he took the evening out and then he's different bloke 
yeah 
i said to you you know
yeah
and i said he said no you're not being but sometimes i feel as though i am you know it's the change 
no you can't tell i wouldn't know unless you said 
i sit down to the table and watch me real men aren't like that are they and it locks 
yeah
and some sit in you know it's locked 
yes yes
so i go have job to find it he just looks at me hard nails 
well he's not a party-goer really 
no it's only cos he doesn't 
he's not 
understand it
he's er he could do without this then 
i suppose a little greek mythology did fit in really lived with you as long you've lived with him really 
yes 
here we are two role forms 
i'll leave you to it 
oh 
just 
do you have to 
tell gerald that 
do you think i'll be able to fill these in 
hello dot
hello
we're here again
what's that
it's alright don't worry about it 
i say what have you got on your
she's taping it all she holds it against you you see so she's trying to blackmail 
oh 
it's all to do with language in the nineteen nineties jean
oh
and this man came to the door and he went to get the belt that should just have a tape recorder on conversation just throughout the week so it's getting all sorts of rubbish going in there 
and it's all do with erm you know people and the erm wives and language of the nineties 
go and get a drink 
i shall move yes dear
so i get a free twenty five pound worth of marks and spencers erm gift vouchers which 
what twenty
yeah
have to cut costs 
bribery and corruption 
i hear you've got two twentieth century 
i'll do anything for money and chocolate 
i hear you've got two twentieth century
oh right yeah well i was so worn out 
what have you got 
that the pages are always sticky with sellotape and so on 
actually it must be quite interesting looking at the development of language as time goes on 
mm well that that's all that's for 
it'll be interesting in the year two thousand and ninety to look backand see what we used to do in the nineteen nineties
i should think i'll be dead just then 
i don't think i'll be around then 
well you won't 
somehow 
be around but it'll be fascinating cos you'll be recorded for life june
that's it 
and i'll 
sorry i'm going to speak to dot i was just going to speak to dot and i'm 
oh 
i shouldn't talk to her if i were you
no 
say something sensible
yes love i am going to say something sensible 
come to tell you
alright
how many little do you have
it varies considerably you can have eight you can up to fourteen except fifteen why how many do you want in 
no it's alright cos someone's rung up from home say be in eight o'clock so she wants to do something
right
she said ooh you know can i invite a couple of friends can i invite sort of you know people back to lunch but when it's sort of the list i mean cos i i'm not 
invite 
well i've got to know cos sort of adult as well i mean you included as i mean it's to put 
getting a bit long
yes 
i'd invite them 
yes i mean it's her sort of age
old of having it 
well that's you know what i mean it's got the 
it's more cosy
and at home
if she wants her sister 
no yeah but on the day no on the day
when is it
can we go
erm 
i know that but will you make it stick 
yes oh well
can you be a path finder leader on the sunday because 
no 
no you know what i mean
but if you can you know agree to tell him 
and the 
but i'll find them and you won't have any bother
oh i know but i mean sort of there i don't know she would actually when it comes to it but if we see her up there cos we can do the 
it's nice to see erm michael and sophie 
yeah
actually it's quite a cosy group so they probably know each other by 
yeah 
now then
yeah
looks a bit agitated
but anyway 
that's somebody that would would be a few 
telling everyone about her mum and dad when they and erm how she talked to her mum about that and it helped her 
but her mum i mean i know 
cos i mean i know her mum 
she 
well vaguely but 
are they moving to to be with someone else or
i don't know i mean i don't 
but perhaps he doesn't want to change till cos she'll 
yeah but she 
so whether they think well so it's after six months 
well 
i dunno
is that alright
they were they were really nice
i hate being sick and one thing another well it turned out 
yeah you do 
yeah
sophie was supposed to be doing the chorus so i grabbed mary and said come with me on the half way through called sophie why are you doing all the talking dot and not mary 
cos she 
cos she's supposed to be andy
oh 
so sarah had a job to do but it wasn't sort of till the end and we're gonna finish too quickly because normally we have it like paul and helen being really with it and look there's sort of upward
oh no
and then down below there's helen you know christopher and 
yeah 
then laura's with him
but none of them turned up to today so 
actually can you really face the from the other pathfinders 
mm cos she'll see you there
cos we're having not problems but at school it really it's unfortunate because she was put in a third year and she's only a third year now and she was on a third year class last year 
who else is there with her in there 
they're all
well we've actually chose the brownies now her age
yeah
yeah
but it really hit her this year we felt quite disgruntled 
yeah 
that i really but i mean last year still not finished 
she's really funny 
so we had a laugh well said he when he woke up he said day one you can do three on one day 
mind you she's like that better get 
when you're feeling keen i said you can do a lot and then 
they're rather weed i know my two even 
erm rather than
i suppose cos he's done that at school
yeah that's right 
they come home they've gotta snuggle up in bed with a book 
yeah 
you know or patrick's into psalms she loves poetry 
psalms i thought 
why not
i used to do it oh what psalm is it she 
i've forgotten about being in mud was it a 
 she did it 
yeah
but as they do it's gonna hit her cos it's not year that it doesn't help see if she's in a third year class she was always as she is now in the top of that but even 
that's right 
when she was only a second year therefore that means she's not given enough work but i mean 
i know what you mean
she's sort of got with children then because this erm testing they've got to a school work outside 
curriculum
they've that's it they do have to take them on to 
the next 
i mean 
yeah well she's sort of with the third year and will admit she's so fed up
but i i'm 
oh yeah
there's a lot of 
i mean i'm glad she's er september and an august birthday i would of hated to have gone 
well i'm glad of that my children cos all 
yeah 
mine are like that 
and it does mean that they can relax you know about work and everything
yeah
cos you know they're a million times ahead 
they've got an extra 
yeah haven't got to worry 
all of them so when her class came up cos she'd been with the class right from nursery and when she put into this you know with the double third year cos they go upstairs for third and fourth year and they really do classes below she didn't know anything in the class 
no 
i mean er she they weren't
no i suppose er it's a bit hard on the kid sort of work wise expecting her to be her to be er ahead but not
but friends means such a lot don't they at that age
yeah
they see 
oh right yeah
we've got we've still not got it yet
oh you've got the 
well we had we had it two weeks ago
yes and they were away too 
they were away 
 gonna be away another two weeks by the sound of it
but when she gets back 
yeah 
i don't know i must talk to marilyn about it
shame really
there again it's if we give 
oh oh are you
we'll give
oh
we're giving it to her
ooh

the one with you chop the chop and then there will be squares
